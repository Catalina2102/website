# Rahtz Prize for Ingenuity 2024 Winner: Scholarly XML

[The Scholarly XML extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raffazizzi.sxml), by Raffaele Viglianti, is the winner of this year's Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity. 

Scholarly XML adds to the suite of independently produced tools and extensions that make TEI more accessible. VS Code is an industry standard editor, and since both it and the Scholarly XML extension are free to use, Scholarly XML significantly reduces the financial barriers to teaching TEI in the classroom or as the code base for underfunded projects. There are future plans for Scholarly XML: Joey Takeda of Simon Fraser University and a student at University of Maryland are working to introduce Schematron validation to the extension.  

[Scholarly XML was first used in 2020 as part of joint course offered by Gimena del Rio Riande and Raffaele Viglianti](https://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000591/000591.html), bringing together students from the University of Maryland, College Park and the Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires in 2020. 

Heartiest congratulations to the Scholarly XML team.
The 2024 Rhatz Prize Evaluation Committee, Constance Crompton (Univiersty of Ottawa),James Cummings (Newcastle University) and Frank Fischer (Freie Universit√§t Berlin) 

Do you know of a TEI project that might merit this prize? Keep an eye out for the next call for nominations in spring 2025.
