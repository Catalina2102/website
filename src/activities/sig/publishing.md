# Scholarly Publishing SIG




 Overview
 
 The TEI Special Interest Group on Scholarly Publishing, approved and created in June
 2009, focuses on the use of TEI in original scholarly publication, as the medium of
 authorship and archival format from which print, Web, ebook, and other formats may
 be
 derived.


**Convener:** The convener of the SIG is Daniel O'Donnell of the
 University of Lethbridge.


**Wiki:** the SIG maintains a [Wiki
 page](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Scholarly_Publishing) as a resource for discussion, documentation, and ongoing work.


**Email list:**[TEI\-PUB\-SIG](https://listserv.brown.edu/?A0=TEI-PUB-SIG) at Brown U.




 Scope
 
 The first objective of this SIG is to establish TEI P5 as an archival format for
 monographs and academic trade books, as well as for scholarly journal articles. This
 would entail exploring a specific customization or possibly a set of customizations
 that could be used for book and journal publishing, and will look to TEI Tite or
 another customization to fit this role. The use of a single source archival XML file
 would not only fulfill preservation needs but would also facilitate the creation of
 multiple electronic book and journal article formats, and as such would allow for
 publishing in any medium.


Additionally, the SIG will consider best practices for XML workflows within
 publishing. For example, when should TEI encoding enter the traditional publishing
 process: during the process of authorship and editing; directly after a book is
 finalized for print; or at a late stage, supplied by the typesetter or other vendor?
 Smaller and even medium\-sized presses continue to do some in\-house typesetting, and
 handling XML in the composition process will require attention. Best practices
 regarding transformations of the XMLâ€”into HTML for online presentation, into PDF
 files, and into electronic book formats, such as ePub, will also be investigated.


Finally, the development of Schematron rules in order to check the quality of the
 XML
 will be explored. Since the types of content being discussed are of similar
 structure, and since presses will be looking for some of the same problems, this
 process would be better suited to community\-based discussion.




 Context
 
 Many university presses and other scholarly publishers are facing the challenge of
 adopting XML as part of their traditional workflows, and for the most part the work
 is being done in isolation. Since the obstacles are fairly common across the board,
 a
 community\-driven approach is the ideal way for presses to face these problems and
 to
 develop solutions.


Adopting a standard customization following the model of TEI Tite would level the
 playing field for all the participating presses, and allow for other workflow issues
 to be discussed within the same context. Many presses have not yet chosen an XML
 schema for an XML\-based workflow, and the simple creation of this SIG would allow
 a
 space for them to witness progress among their peers and would hopefully increase
 the
 adoption rate of TEI as the scholarly publishing schema of choice.




 Goals
 
 The SIG will concentrate its acitivites on developing best practices around the
 adoption of a TEI\-based XML workflow. Some of these best practices will be applicable
 to workflows based on other XML schemas, but the primary goals will center on
 TEI.


The primary work objectives are listed below:


* Adoption of a standard TEI customization or customizations
	+ TEI Tite as a model?
	+ Other customizations?
* XML workflow for print publication
	+ MS Word .dot style template
	+ Born\-TEI workflows
* Conversions to other Formats
	+ Stylesheets
	+ Other tools
* Schematron rules




 Activities
 
 The SIG held a working meeting at the 2009 members meeting and conference in Ann Arbor.
