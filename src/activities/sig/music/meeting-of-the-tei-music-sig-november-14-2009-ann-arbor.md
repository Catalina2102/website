# Meeting of the TEI Music SIG: November 14, 2009, Ann Arbor




The focus of this year's meeting was on reporting the aims and the status of
 ongoing work. In addition to this meeting, these were also topics of informal
 talks throughout the entire conference. 


The SIG's decision to focus on MEI first led to discussion of the current status
 of the "ODDification" of MEI and the related question of how to combine MEI and
 TEI. Whether to subsume MEI into TEI, keep them separate, or adopt a process
 somewhere between these poles remains an open question. This question was
 discussed not only in a technical sense of how to combine the schemas and
 namespaces, but also on a political level with regard to how both the text and
 music markup communities can mutually benefit. 


A first step towards documentation of MEI is in progress, too. As part of the
 DFG/NEH\-funded project "Digital Music Notation Data Model and Prototype Delivery
 System", a list of problems concerning the encoding of music notation alone as
 well as in combination with text is currently under discussion. Potential
 solutions to these problems will be documented and illustrative examples will be
 encoded, which will be helpful for the SIG's work. 


Finally, a significant announcement was made at the meeting. As a sub\-part of the
 German TextGrid project, a music notation editor will be developed. While
 in\-depth TEI support is not on the agenda of this effort, the software's
 underlaying data format will be MEI, so that hopefully the possibility to
 create, edit, and display MEI\-encoded music will come to fruition soon.
