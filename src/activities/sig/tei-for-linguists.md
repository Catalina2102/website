# TEI for Linguists SIG




Context
-------



 
 The TEI recommendations relevant for linguists are scattered across several chapters
 of the Guidelines, especially the chapters: [Transcriptions of Speech](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TS.html) (ch. 8\), [Dictionaries](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DI.html) (ch. 9\), [Language Corpora](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CC.html) (ch. 15\), [Simple Analytic Mechanisms](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html) (ch. 17\) and [Feature Structures](/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/FS.html) (ch. 18\). There used to be an effort to build a possible chapter on corpus encoding,
 but the effort was not conclusive. However, TEI\-based annotation schemes are not as
 widely known among linguists as most TEI\-insiders would expect. Consequently, it is
 not used very often in linguistics. This SIG addresses this situation and promotes
 the TEI Guidelines within this large group of researchers.
 
 
Scope
-----



 
 Within linguistics, the use of “Language Resources” increases constantly. The aim
 of the SIG “TEI for Linguists” is to provide a common, uniform set of recommendations
 for the encoding of Language Resources with TEI markup. This relates to both “item\-based”
 resources (lexica, ontologies) and “text\-based” resources (corpora). These types of
 resources or also regarded as static resources, when contrasted with dynamic language
 resources like parsers, taggers etc. Moreover, the SIG “TEI for Linguists” wants to
 become a forum for scholars who want to consider the use of TEI markup schemes for
 some of the diverse linguistic tasks. Some of the main tasks of this SIG are:
 
 * the identification of issues that “Ordinary Working Linguists” would like the TEI
 to be able to handle for them (e.g. the encoding of corpora and lexica, but also ‘everyday
 encoding of linguistic structures’ for the purpose of teaching or theorizing);
* the promotion of modules that could be used in linguistic subdisciplines, e.g. computational
 linguists could make use of the feature structures module or phoneticians could use
 (and extend) the TEI module for the transcription of speech;
* the creation of a module (or a set of them) for linguistic description, as a separate
 chapter of the Guidelines or a set of ODDs to enable linguists to to use the TEI encoding
 more easily;
* interfacing with other TEI SIGs whenever they brush against linguistic issues (Ontology
 SIG for lexical databases, Overlap SIG for corpus encoding, Tools SIG for language
 description and processing tools);
* the possibility of collaboration with researchers working within ISO TC 37 SC 4 ([http://www.tc37sc4\.org/](http://www.tc37sc4.org/)).
