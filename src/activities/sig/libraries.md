# Libraries SIG



The goal of the TEI Special Interest Group on Libraries is to discuss topics regarding
 the
 use of TEI in library, including the creation of guidelines to best practice that
 encourage
 the consistent and predictable encoding of TEI documents. Greater consistency and
 predictability will facilitate the interchange of documents, interoperability of systems,
 and the creation of standard tools for libraries to use in the creation and publication
 of
 TEI documents.


It will do this by, among other things: 
 


* Updating and improving the current 
 [Best Practices for TEI in Libraries](http://purl.oclc.org/NET/teiinlibraries)
* Creation of standard XSL style sheets for use (see, for example, 
 [Thutmose II](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Thutmose_II), development
 of which was funded by a grant from the TEI Consortium to the SIG on Libraries)
* Exploring the use of other metadata standards commonly in use in libraries, such as
 METS, MODS, EAD, and MARC, in conjunction with TEI documents
* Guides to implementing TEI collections in digital library platforms


The TEI in uses the [TEILIB\-L list](https://iulist.indiana.edu/sympa/info/teilib-l), which 
 anyone may join. Curious about previous discussion threads? Visit the [TEILIB\-L Archives](https://iulist.indiana.edu/sympa/arc/teilib-l).


The SIG also maintains a number of [wiki pages](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Libraries).
