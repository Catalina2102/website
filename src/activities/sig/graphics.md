# Text & Graphics Special Interest Group



 The TEI Guidelines are used to encode many diverse, graphically rich documents,
 including illuminated manuscripts, laboratory notebooks, art books, children's
 illustrated books, comics and graphic novels, and so on. These types of graphically
 rich documents present special concerns, considerations, and challenges, both
 conceptually at the encoding level and technically at the transformation,
 presentation, and publishing layers of digital document development.
 
 The purpose of this SIG will be to discuss, develop, and document various strategies
 and best practices for implementing the digital facsimile structures available in
 TEI P5, especially as relates to graphically rich texts, and for developing methods
 to extend the TEI when existing structures are not suitable.
 
 The conveners of the SIG are [John Walsh](mailto:jawalsh@indiana.edu) and
 [Martin de la Iglesia](mailto:iglesia@hab.de). The SIG maintains a [mailing list](https://listserv.brown.edu/?A0=TEI-GRAPHICS-SIG) and [a TEI wiki
 page](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Text%26Graphic).
 
 ### Activities



The Text \& Graphics SIG first convened at the third annual TEI Member's
 Meeting in Nancy, 2003\. The SIG usually convenes at the annual Members' Meeting.
