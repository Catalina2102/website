# TEI Tools SIG



The goal of the TEI Special Interest Group on Tools (formerly "Presentation") is to
 bring together members who wish to share information about XML\-TEI compatible tools.
 This covers:
 


* editing tools to encode texts and corpora
* conversion and preprocessing tools
* transformation and presentation languages such as XSLT
* querying tools such as native XML databases
* publishing and delivery tools
* analysis tools like Xaira, Philologic, etc.


The main channel of information for the SIG is the [TEI WIKI](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Tools).


The SIG runs a mailing list on this topic. Click [here](https://listserv.brown.edu/?SUBED1=tei-tools-sig&A=1) to join.
