# TEI SIG on Correspondence - Minutes Zadar, Nov 13, 2010




Participation: around 5 people


Peter gave a report on last year's activities
 
 + Task force ‘Dalfy’ was established after the Ann Arbor Meeting: Markus Flatscher,
 Bert Van Raemdonck, Peter Stadler
+ Goal: Mapping of DALF (P4\) to TEI P5 as a basis for further work on a correspondence
 customization
+ But: Momentum got lost …
+ Further: Some discussion on TEI\-L about "signed vs. salute"


A brief look on open questions
 
 + Correspondence meta data: correspDesc?
+ The content model of postscript (cf. the Collection of Postscript\-Examples and the
 contributions to the ps\-discussion.)
+ The content model of opener/closer and their connection with salute, signed, dateline,
 byline etc.


Attempt to create a roadmap for 2011
 
 + Peter suggested a second attempt for a grant to achieve the mapping of DALF to P5
+ Discussion about possible fundings for such an attempt
+ review of the last failed TEI grant proposal: it was criticized by the present panel
 members that no preliminary work was (visibly) carried out
+ Susan suggested to first initiate a survey on the correspondence list
