# Minutes of the TEI Presentation Tools SIG Meeting in Sofia, 29 October 2005




Here's a report on the Presentational Tools SIG meeting at this year's TEI
 meeting in Bulgaria, the third such meeting since the SIG was convened at the
 TEI Member's Meeting in Nancy, France in 2003\.


This year's meeting took place on 29/10/2005 and those attending were: 


* Kevin Hawkins
* Federico Meschini
* Sebastian Rahtz
* Miranda Remnek
* Paul Spence


In terms of the meeting as a whole, I think we had a useful session in spite of
 the small number of people there. We spoke about most of the issues that have
 come up in previous meetings and on the list before, but tried to identify some
 concrete steps to move this SIG forward.






1\. List of tools* Much of our discussion centred on producing an updated list of tools
 that people could refer to if they wanted to know how other people
 have gone about presenting/querying their TEI texts. We've talked
 about this in the past, but it's been difficult to decide how to
 structure it, and to work out how exactly it would relate more
 widely to TEI material.


Here were some ideas we came up with:


	+ To start with, we thought a simple list of tools could be
	 added somewhere on the TEI website, with some basic information
	 about what they do. Since this was already started some time
	 ago, someone volunteered to take the previous list and add it to
	 the Wiki.
	+ It was felt by some people that it might be useful to tie
	 this in with a call to the projects listed at the url below
	 to update their information:
	
	
	
	[http://www.tei\-c.org/Applications/](http://www.tei-c.org/Applications/)
	
	
	It was suggested that we might update the form that people
	 complete when they want to add their project. This could not
	 only help some of the listed TEI projects to update their
	 information, but also might enable us to gather some
	 information about what kinds of tools people have used in
	 the past. This would obviously need to be discussed with the
	 TEI Board.
2\. Useful resources* We also discussed producing a simple catalogue of non\-TEI specific
 but related resources to strengthen the links between the TEI
 community and other communities which had significant shared
 interests (e.g. Digital Medievalist, Digital Classicist). While not
 directly relevant to presentational tools, in practice it can be
 useful to do research on some presentation\-related questions across
 various fora (e.g. character encoding issues, or how to go about
 producing a digital edition).


How we structure SIG\-related material, and the means by which we make
 it available, obviously both depend on the broader question of how
 the TEI website and wiki are used by the wider TEI community in the
 future, and I'll make enquiries about the discussion that was due to
 happen about that in the TEI board meeting in Bulgaria.
3\. Sample corpus for TEI documents* We talked briefly about the sample corpus for tool\-testing but this
 was not deemed a high priority by those present. Do people on the
 list feel that we need to take this item any further? Back in
 January Mark Olsen mentioned a sample corpus they've set up in
 Chicago. My sense is that people will need to build up their own
 samples for testing from time to time, but that the nature of their
 samples will depend a lot on what they're testing (a linguistic tool
 not needing to test the same things as a publishing tool, for
 example), and that developers are now fairly well\-placed to create
 or gather sample documents. What do people think?
4\. OAI* Some interest was also shown in the issue of more widespread resource
 discovery and interoperability outside the TEI world, and in
 particular the manner in which TEI repositories might be made more
 widely available through OAI Service providers. While not directly
 relevant to Presentational tools, some people thought that this
 served wider tool\-related needs, and so agreed to do some
 preparatory research into this area.
