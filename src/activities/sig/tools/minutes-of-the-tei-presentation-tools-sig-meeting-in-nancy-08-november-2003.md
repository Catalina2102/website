# Minutes of the TEI Presentation Tools SIG Meeting in Nancy, 08 November 2003




There was great interest in the Presentation Tools SIG in Nancy. Most of the
 meeting was spent discussing whether we were one SIG or more than one. Some at
 the meeting were interested in TEI as an authoring tool (that is, a markup
 language for creating new documents such as reports and websites, as opposed to
 marking up transcribed documents, such as manuscripts, plays, novels, etc.) and
 others were interested in TEI querying and delivery. Therefore, we split into
 two SIGs. If you are interested in TEI as an authoring tool you can check out
 the [TEI Authoring
 SIG](/Activities/SIG/Authoring/)


From the meeting in Nancy we discovered that many of us in the TEI are in the
 same situation. We have a large body of TEI\-encoded documents and we would like
 to delivery these to end users, typically over the web. We also agreed that this
 is not an easy task. The features we would like in our web publication systems
 are: 


* the ability to perform XML aware queries on a large number of
 TEI\-encoded documents
* to deliver these documents to the end user as HTML (on the
 fly?)

 Item 2 is not as difficult as item 1 since XSLT has become a stable and
 robust way to transform XML to HTML. However, there are many choices as far as
 XSLT processors and web applications to perform the transformations.
 
 Since so many TEI users are tackling the same issues, we thought it made sense to
 share our knowledge and experience. To that end we would like to use this
 mailing list and web space as: 


* an area to which TEI members, subscribers, and users can come when
 they want to answer the question "After it's all in XML, what then?
* a resource for information on the different XML processing
 technologies
* a place for users to share experience with these technologies so we
 are not all starting from scratch and "rolling our own"
* a place where members can provide links to their own XML applications
 if they wish to share them


The consensus in Nancy was an interest in web delivery tools, but this does not
 mean that the SIG will be limited only to this. It is open to any discussion on
 processing and presenting XML.
