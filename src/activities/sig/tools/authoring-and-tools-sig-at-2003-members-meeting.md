# Authoring and Tools SIG at 2003 Members Meeting




 Authoring
 
 
 Using TEI markup for reports, web sites etc. 
 It makes sense to use the same markup
 in your writing as you use in research. This provides a lot of potential
 for getting the TEI used. 
 However, the process must be
 invisible for non\-TEI folks, using an editor which hides TEI
 from the writer. There is a need for a range of tools
 which allow neophytes to start on the TEI with a low barrier; 
 given that they will then start to abuse the semantics of the 
 TEI. Does this matter? Can people be persuaded to deal with ideas of
 abstract markup? Two schools of thought:
 


* teach them Emacs, force them to confront reality
* hide everything in OpenOffice and make people write TEI without
 knowing they are doing so


 Is there a place for an editing system which censors the
 document on the fly? ie removing empty paragraphs?
 
 
 What about simplification of schemas for editing? ie suppress
 everything but a very small set of tags at a given time.


We need examples of document types.


Is TEI Lite sufficient for authoring reports? What additional tags are
 needed? Can we incrementally build up a new tag set based on user
 practice? Start with the Lite tags and add to them as a group of
 authors request new features? Is there a single set of additions
 needed for «authoring»? Do we need to simply add some extra tags in
 general, or start looking at quite distinct developments for different
 areas? Do we need modules of some kind? Alternatively, is this a
 problem calling out for namespaces? ie combining together bits from
 the TEI, or other XML languages, as needed?


Authoring web sites: do we describe web pages as TEI documents, or
 web sites as TEI documents? ie does the TEI markup cover the site
 architecture?




 Presentation
 
 
 How do we deliver a text we have just created? There is a lack 
 of an integrated suite of tools. We have lots of bits of software to do
 parts of the job, but not enough documentation and descriptions
 of good practice about how they all fit together. People getting
 started with the TEI don't know where to start. Why isn't this on
 the TEI Applications web page? Projects should describe their
 technical setup, ideally as part of their initial submission.


Presentation is part of a project, it needs to be 
 preserved along with the text.




 User interface issues
 
 What common tools are needed to make use of TEI\-tagged texts?
 There are three stages:
 


* description: accessing everything that is in the text
* analysis: what is happening in the text? how should the reader approach it
* interpretation: generating new knowledge from the text?


 To move forward on this, we need to use common tools, in particular
 a common search engine; more precisely, a common interface to
 XML search engines. What sort of queries do TEI people need to make?
 We should avoid any lock\-in to particular pieces of software; although
 that does not mean we cannot usefully share experience of individual
 software packages.
 
 
 There is a need to bring resources together into super collections;
 although this depends on due resolution of IPR problems. Perhaps there
 are issues of integrating TEI texts in a virtual corpus, when their
 markup is not entirely consonant.




 The way forward
 
 We decided to set up two linked mini\-SIGs:
 


* to get together people who will actually
 
 use authoring subsets of the TEI and propose
 which extra tags are needed. There will be a public repository of
 authoring schemes, and (hopefully) tool support as needed. 
 If all goes, we will end up with some universally\-agreed extensions,
 and some specialized modules. Sebastian Rahtz to coordinate.
* to look at presentation tools. This includes problems like interfaces to
 search engines. Matt Zimmerman to coordinate.


 can these two be clearly separated? Authoring schemas always need
 tools immediately implementing them. We will see how this pans out.
 
Report from Matt Zimmerman
 
 
 We had a very large turnout for this combined SIG and decided that
 the presentation tools and user\-interface groups had a lot in common,
 whereas the authoring group was a bit separate. Our conclusion was
 that many of us in the TEI are experimenting with different tools to
 query and present our encoded documents on the web and it would be
 useful for us to share this information, first among ourselves, and
 later possibly on the TEI website. Though we have no intention of
 making a "TEI publication suite" we would like to share our knowledge
 of different XML querying and web publication tools since our goals
 are very similar. Our first post\-conference activity was to establish
 a listserv for the group. If you want to join our discussion send a
