# Overlapping Markup SIG




The goal of the TEI is to bring
 together users of the TEI who are acutely interested in
 issues of multiple hierarchies and in particular handling
 those in XML.


It will do this by:
 
 
- running a mailing list about overlapping hierarchies
 and solutions to encoding them

- assess the TEI and suggest improvements and
 alterations to the TEI\-Council






The SIG is convened by Dorothy Carr Porter.


The SIG runs a mailing list on this topic. To join visit
