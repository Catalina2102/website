# East Asian/Japanese SIG



The East Asian cultural region has a long and rich literary tradition that extends
 as
 far back as the first millennium BCE. While the basic writing system for most of the
 early and middle of East Asian literature was that of the Chinese ideograph
 (
 hanzi), the cultures on the periphery of the 
 hanzi
 cultural sphere also began to develop their own native scripts, which were used both
 alone, as well as in mixed form with Chinese ideographs. For example, the Japanese
 syllabic writing system called 
 kana began to develop soon after the
 turn of the first millennium CE, and the Korean 
 hangeul system came
 into widespread use in the fifteenth century. Japanese 
 kana includes a
 few variants, mainly 
 hiragana (round cursive script),
 
 katakana (square cursive script), and 
 hentaigana
 (nonstandard script). The third, which was popular in premodern Japanese printing
 is
 now nearly obsolete, but it was recently proposed for inclusion to ISO/IEC 10646 for
 usage in government documents and research. For historical reasons, Japanese
 documents embrace several writing systems: not only the above three
 
 kana systems but also parts of the Chinese writing systems and
 hybrid writings partially derived from Korean Peninsula before the spreading of the
 
 hangeul script.


On the other hand, Japanese researchers have recently engaged themselves in encoding
 Japanese and East Asian texts according to the TEI guidelines. However, while there
 is already a large amount of Japanese electronic texts on the Web, including over
 10,000 public domain texts distributed by Aozora\-Bunko (similar with Gutenberg
 project) and Buddhist texts including 100 million characters, Japanese textual
 researchers have often faced difficulties in various levels of TEI\-XML encoding,
 such as the lack of appropriate elements and attributes, differences of text models,
 and management of sharing good practices of encoding.


To begin to deal with these kinds of problems, we have formed the Special Interest
 Group for East Asian/Japanese. We expect the SIG to be a window between the
 consortium and Japanese practitioners to improve the situation. Therefore, we will
 address to form a general guideline for encoding Japanese text within TEI P5
 Guidelines and clarify the lack of parts of textual models and elements in the
 guidelines in the first phase.


Furthermore, one of our primary goals would be to expand the SIG to cover East Asian
 Texts more broadly, including Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese
 practitioners.


The SIG also maintains a number of [wiki pages](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:East_Asian).
