# Scholarly Publishing SIG: TEI XML Workflows and Best Practices




Scope
 
 *\[Following is the original form of the SIG proposal submitted to TEI Council and Board
 on 4 June 2009]*


The first objective of this SIG is to establish TEI P5 as an archival format for monographs
 and academic trade books, as well as for scholarly journal articles. This would entail
 exploring a specific customization or possibly a set of customizations that could
 be used for book and journal publishing, and will specifically look to TEI Tite to
 fit this role. The use of a single source archival XML file would not only fulfill
 preservation needs but would also facilitate the creation of multiple electronic book
 and journal article formats, and as such would allow for publishing in any medium.


Additionally, the creation of best practices for XML workflows within publishing will
 be explored. This includes when encoding would enter the traditional publishing process\-\-whether
 it is prior to the composition process or directly after the book is finalized for
 print\-\-or whether it should be vendor\-supplied in entirety. Smaller and even medium\-sized
 presses continue to do some inhouse typesetting, and handling XML in the composition
 process will require some focus. Best practices regarding transformations of the XML\-\-into
 HTML for online purposes, into PDF files, and into electronic book formats, such as
 ePub, will also be investigated.


Finally, the development of Schematron rules in order to check the quality of the
 XML will be explored. Since the types of content being discussed are of similar structure,
 and since presses will be looking for some of the same problems, this process would
 be better suited to community\-based discussion.




 Context
 
 Many university presses are facing the challenge of adopting XML as part of their
 traditional workflows, and for the most part the work is being done in isolation.
 Since the obstacles are fairly common across the board, a community\-driven approach
 is the ideal way for presses to face these problems and to develop solutions.


Adopting a standard such as TEI Tite would level the playing field for all the participating
 presses, and allow for other workflow issues to be discussed within the same context.
 Many presses have not yet chosen an XML schema for an XML\-based workflow, and the
 simple creation of this SIG would allow a space for them to witness progress among
 their peers and would hopefully increase the adoption rate of TEI as the university
 press publishing schema of choice.




 Program of work
 
 The activity of this SIG will generally be focused on developing best practices around
 the adoption of a TEI\-based XML workflow. Some of these best practicies will be able
 to be applied to workflows centered on other XML schemas, but the primary goals will
 center on TEI.


The primary work objectives are listed below:


* Adoption of a standard TEI customization
	+ TEI Tite
* XML workflow for print publication
* Conversions to other Formats
	+ Stylesheets
	+ Other tools
* Schematron rules




 Related work
 
 The SIG members will monitor and (where appropriate) participate in other related
 initiatives, in particular to see whether tools discussed within this SIG or within
 the Tools SIG can be applied elsewhere.
