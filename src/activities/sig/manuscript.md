# TEI Manuscripts Special Interest Group




The goal of the TEI Special Interest Group on Manuscripts is to bring together users
 of the TEI who wish to improve the encoding strategies for marking up transcriptions
 and editions of manuscript materials.
This SIG explores a range of issues common to editing manuscripts, including:


* how to record the physical appearance of a manuscript or printed witness
* how to record different writing acts
* how to record scribal error and correction
* how to encode fragmentary witnesses
* how to record codicological information
* how to record different kinds of variation within or across witnesses
* how to use the critical apparatus tag set in manuscript transcription


The group operates by means a mailing list and also has an area on the [TEI wiki](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:MSS "TEI wiki").
 
 The SIG is convened by Stephen McCormick and Gerrit Brüning. The SIG runs a mailing
 list, which you can join by visiting [http://listserv.brown.edu/tei\-ms\-sig.html](https://listserv.brown.edu/tei-ms-sig.html)


Current and Past Activities
---------------------------


The SIG is collecting issues regarding [chapter 11](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html "chapter 11") of the TEI Guidelines on [GitHub](https://github.com/SteveWLU/TEI-MS-SIG "GitHub").
The Manuscripts SIG has held meetings on all recent TEI Conference and Members' Meetings.
Notable earlier outputs of the SIG:
* A [Workgroup on Genetic Editions](https://www.tei-c.org/SIG/Manuscripts/genetic.html "Workgroup on Genetic Editions") with this SIG developed [An Encoding Model for Genetic Editions](https://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/Working/tcw19.html "An Encoding Model for Genetic Editions"). The proposal was mostly integrated in version 2\.0 of chapter 11 of the TEI Guidelines
 (see the [release notes](https://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P5/current/doc/tei-p5-doc/readme-2.0.html "release notes")).
* A Critical Apparatus Workgroup wrote a [report on problems](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Critical_Apparatus_Workgroup "report on problems") of the [Critical Apparatus chapter](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html "Critical Apparatus chapter") and module of the TEI Guidelines.
