# TEI Training: Short Courses
Short TEI Training Courses
--------------------------


*Compiled 7 October 2004*

The goal of the TEI Special Interest Group on Training is to support and encourage
training and teaching of the TEI, at workshops, seminars, and at the university level by
making available a variety of TEI\-related resources.


Those present at the TEI meeting in Nancy in October 2003, agreed to edit specific
sections of this site with the goal of having a variety of resources available for the
2004 TEI meeting. The following is a list of short courses with substantial TEI content.
If you have a course you would like added to this list, please email [Susan Schreibman](mailto:susan.schreibman@gmail.com)




Summer Schools



ESSLI, European Summer School in Logic, Language and InformationAnnotation of Language Resources ESSLLI 1999, 2002 and 2005 Trainer: [Tomaž Erjavec](http://nl.ijs.si/et/)


The course will be given at the [17th
ESSLLI](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/), taking place at Heriot\-Watt University Edinburgh, Scotland 8\-19 August,
2005


Slides for the previous (ESSLLI02\) course are available from


Annotation of language resources is an introductory course with
the duration of one week (10hrs). The course consists of three parts. First it
introduces XML and related developments, i.e. namespaces, XPath and XSLT, XML schemas.
It then moves on to TEI and illustrates it with applications relevant to annotated
multilingual corpora and feature structures. The last part covers the more important
Semantic Web related initiatives in encoding meta\-data and semantic features: the Dublin
Core, RDF, RDFS, and OWL.



[Digital Humanities / Humanities Computing

Text Encoding Fundamentals and their ApplicationTrainers: Julia Flanders (Brown U) and Barbara Bond (U Victoria) 25\-30 June
2004; TBA 2005For those new to the field, this offering provides an introduction to the theory and
practice of encoding electronic texts for the humanities. This workshop is designed
for individuals who are contemplating embarking on a text encoding project, or for
those who would like to better understand the philosophy, theory, and practicalities
of encoding in XML (Extensible Markup Language) using the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) guidelines. No previous knowledge of XML or the TEI is necessary, but a
familiarity with HTML would be useful.
Intermediate Encoding: Advanced TEI Encoding Issues, Metadata, and Text
TransformationsTrainer: Susan Schreibman (U Maryland) and Matt Jockers (U Stanford) 25\-30 June
2004; TBA 2005For those who have experience in encoding basics such as those offered in Text
Encoding Fundamentals and their Application, the focus of this course will be on
developing the skills needed to mount a collection of texts online. The first day of
the course will utilise a case\-based approach to explore advanced topics in TEI
encoding. The rest of the course will be devoted to reading and writing DTDs, XSLT
stylesheets (including XPath syntax), and developing a metadata scheme for resource
discovery. Instruction style will be a combination of lecture format, with hands\-on
exercises and a large project component.

Text Encoding, TEI\-XML and EADTrainer: Susan Schreibman (U Maryland) 2003


This workshop provides an introduction to the theory and practice of encoding
electronic texts for the humanities. This workshop is designed for individuals who are
contemplating embarking on a text encoding project, or for those who would like to
better understand the philosophy, theory, and practicalities of encoding in XML
(Extensible Markup Language) using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines,
and/or Encoded Archival Description (EAD). No previous knowledge of XML, the TEI or
EAD is necessary. However, a familiarity with HTML would be useful.

20\-23 January 2004 Trainers: Susan Schreibman (U Maryland), Amit Kumar (U
Maryland), Tanya Clement (U Maryland) University of Maryland; College Park, MD


The first two days of the workshop will introduce students to the theory and practice
of text encoding using Extensible Markup Language (XML). We will be focusing on
encoding through the scheme most humanities projects utilize, the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI), one of the oldest and most robust text encoding schemes available.
The last two\-days of the workshop will introduce students to the practicalities of
transforming XML documents through Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSLT).

the TEI](http://www.mith.umd.edu/outreach/xml_workshop.html)


24\-25 January 2002 Trainers: Susan Schreibman (U Maryland), Lara Vetter (U
Maryland), George Williams (U Maryland)


This hands\-on workshop at MITH provides an introduction to the theory and practice of
encoding electronic texts for the humanities. If you are taking part in a project
involving electronic texts, are thinking about embarking on a project, or would just
like to understand the philosophy, theory, and practicalities of encoding in XML
(Extensible Markup Language) using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines, this
workshop is for you. No previous knowledge of XML or the TEI is necessary for this
workshop. However, a familiarity with HTML would be useful.

den Branden](mailto:ron.vandenbranden@kantl.be) (Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature)The first Manuscript \& Electronic Text Academy (META) introduces the field of
digitization of text and images and text encoding to both students and professionals of
the textual, cultural, and heritage sectors. The week\-long workshop consists of four
modules; any of which can be booked separately. Three taught modules focus on XML,
Digital Images, and DALF respectively. The META workshop week closes with a half\-day
colloquium featuring demonstrations and reports from active digitization and research
projects utilizing these technologies.Participants in the workshop gain a greater understanding of the latest techniques,
tools and standards in text encoding and digitization in the wonderful historic setting
of the building of the Royal Academy. The internationally renowned staff share a wide
experience in Humanities Computing and consist of Melissa Terras (School of Library,
Archive, and Information Studies, University College London, UK), Edward Vanhoutte and
Ron Van den Branden (Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document Studies\-CTB).

The five\-day workshop will provide introductory training in the theory and practice of
digitizing text and image for those working in book and text studies. Training in these
skills for those working in the Humanities is not readily available in South Africa, but
both academics and advanced students are increasingly aware of the need to bring their
work into line with that of colleagues elsewhere implementing more advanced
technologies. Throughout the workshop week, applications to electronic editing: poetry,
prose, epistolary material, genetic editing, image based editing etc. will be
demonstrated. The programme will be run by a team appointed by an international body,
the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), which is also providing
the funding for the workshops, and consisting of Melissa Terras (School for Library,
Archive and Information Studies, University College London, UK), Ron Van den Branden,
and Edward Vanhoutte (both Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document Studies, Royal
Academy of Dutch Language and Literature, Belgium).

as part of the pre\-conference activities connected with the 2003 and 2004 ACH/ALLC
conferences. The first workshop (one day) introduced students to the theory and
practice of text encoding using Extensible Markup Language (XML), focusing on encoding
through the scheme most humanities projects utilize, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),
one of the oldest and most robust text encoding schemes available. The second workshop
(two days) introduced students to the practicalities of transforming XML documents
through Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSLT).
