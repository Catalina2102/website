# TEI Education SIG Meeting Minutes -- November 2009



The co\-conveners of the TEI Education SIG held a meeting at the TEI Members Meeting
 in Ann Arbor on Saturday, November 14 from 10:00 am – 11:30 am.


Attendees: Stacey Berry, Julia Flanders, Laura Mandell, Julianne Nyhan, Stephanie
 Schlitz, Susan Schreibman (briefly), Beata Wojtowicz


Overview:
 
 
 * The meeting convened with introductions and brief discussions of attendees’ interest
 in the Education SIG. Julianne Nyhan described the background of the SIG, including
 the roles of the co\-conveners.
* Following an overview of the TEI\-EJ project, the primary work of the SIG during 2009,
 Stephanie Schlitz explained how Drupal is being customized to serve as the content
 management system for TEI\-EJ. Stephanie then demonstrated features of the journal’s
 website and explained the aims of the publication.


Discussion:
 
 
 * Julia Flanders pointed out the need to include an editorial/mission statement to reflect
 the journal’s content with regard for the ‘truth’ about TEI, noting the importance
 of indicating that the while the journal aims to represent the TEI accurately, it
 is distinct from the role of the Guidelines, Board, and Council in that it will provide
 a forum for discussion and debate about TEI.
* Laura Mandell described the urgent need for educational materials to support faculty
 and organizations whose primary mission is education, especially in instances where
 electronic projects are being developed without institutionalized technological support.
* Stacey Berry indicated that projects currently in development would benefit from TEI\-EJ
 as a resource for learning about and how to include digital humanities components.
* Julia Flanders and Beata Wojtowicz agreed that TEI offers an effective introduction
 to digital humanities.
* Julia Flanders recommended that TEI\-EJ editors intercept before publication articles
 that include erroneous TEI content, suggesting that while “interestingly wrong” articles
 invite discussion, response, and, as Stephanie suggested, “teachable moments,” they
 must be balanced and corrected.
* Julia Flanders and Laura Mandell raised the possibility of exposing XML as a web service
 for others to use in creating other types of views of XML content.
* Stacey Berry discussed using TEI\-EJ as a resource to answer questions about education
 and learning.
* Stephanie Schlitz shared the pages for TEI teaching and learning resources on the
 TEI\-EJ site.
* Julia Flanders suggested that as a recurring component of TEI\-EJ, individuals could
 be commissioned to select a topic raised on the TEI listserv and to curate a narrative
 on the topic.
* Julianne Nyhan raised the possibility of developing a certificate for graduate students
 who work on TEI\-EJ.
* Stacey Berry introduced the possibility of inviting a post\-doc to guest edit TEI\-EJ
 for a year either as a funded or unfunded endeavor.
* Laura Mandell suggested that TEI\-EJ involve the HASTAC community to create a bridge
 between New Media and Text Encoding.
* Stacey Berry recommended asking grant applicants to agree to have TEI\-EJ review or
 feature their project as a component of their grant application, and Julianne Nyhan
 suggested going directly to funding agencies to ask them to include TEI\-EJ as an outlet
 for publication.
* Julia Flanders commented on using TEI\-EJ to reflect the long term objective of the
 SIG, especially via the learning resources pages.
* Susan Schreibman suggested that a page for documentation examples be created to support
 new TEI adopters.
* Julianne Nyhan shared information about TEI by Example.
* Stephanie Schlitz asked Susan Schreibman about site hosting for TEI\-EJ, indicating
 that the site currently resides on a test server at Bloomsburg University; Susan indicated
 that Digital Humanities Observatory (DHO) would discuss this. Stephanie asked about
 negotiating a hosting agreement with DHO should DHO agree to serve as host. Susan
 Schreibman indicated that such an agreement seemed appropriate.


The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 am.
