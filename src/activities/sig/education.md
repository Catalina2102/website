# Education SIG



The goal of the TEI Special Interest Group on Education (formerly the Training SIG)
 is to support and encourage training and teaching of the TEI, at workshops, seminars,
 and at the university level by making available a variety of TEI\-related resources.
 
 


The SIG runs a mailing list on this topic. To join, send a message to
 [tei\-training\-sig\-subscribe@lists.tei\-c.org.uk](mailto:tei-training-sig-subscribe@lists.tei-c.org.uk)


The SIG also maintains a page on the [TEI wiki](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Education).
 




A detailed
