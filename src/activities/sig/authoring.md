# TEI Authoring SIG



**The Authoring SIG is no longer active.**
The aim of the TEI Special Interest Group on Authoring 
 is to develop good practice in using the TEI markup
 to write modern office\-type documents (reports, web
 pages, articles etc). This covers:
 


* which elements to use from existing modules, and for what
* which new elements or attributes are needed
* ideas about incorporating other XML languages 
 (MathML, SVG, Docbook etc)
* suitable authoring tools


 The aim is to generate:
 


* examples of TEI subsets and extensions used for authoring
* guidelines on for authors thinking of using the TEI
* suggestions to the TEI Technical Council about which new elements
 are needed in P5 to support this area

 Thoughts from a face to face meeting at the 2003 TEI members meeting
 
 This TEI SIG is about using TEI markup for reports, web sites, and
 other documents being created now. The reason for this is that
 it seems to makes sense to use the same markup
 in your writing as you use in research. This provides a lot of potential
 for getting the TEI used. 
 However, the process must be
 invisible for non\-TEI folks, using an editor which hides TEI
 from the writer. There is a need for a range of tools
 which allow neophytes to start on the TEI with a low barrier; 
 given that they will then start to abuse the semantics of the 
 TEI. Does this matter? Can people be persuaded to deal with ideas of
 abstract markup? There are two schools of thought:
 


* teach them Emacs, and force them to confront reality
* hide everything in OpenOffice and make people write TEI without
 knowing they are doing so


 Is there a place for an editing system which censors the
 document on the fly? ie removing empty paragraphs?
 
 
 What about simplification of schemas for editing? ie suppress
 everything but a very small set of tags at a given time.


We need examples of document types.


Is TEI Lite sufficient for authoring reports? What additional tags are
 needed? Can we incrementally build up a new tag set based on user
 practice? Start with the Lite tags and add to them as a group of
 authors request new features? Is there a single set of additions
 needed for «authoring»? Do we need to simply add some extra tags in
 general, or start looking at quite distinct developments for different
 areas? Do we need modules of some kind? Alternatively, is this a
 problem calling out for namespaces? ie combining together bits from
 the TEI, or other XML languages, as needed?


Authoring web sites: do we describe web pages as TEI documents, or
 web sites as TEI documents? ie does the TEI markup cover the site
 architecture?


Our aim is to get together people who will actually
 
 
 use authoring subsets of the TEI and propose
 which extra tags are needed. There will be a public repository of
 authoring schemes, and (hopefully) tool support as needed. 
 If all goes, we will end up with some universally\-agreed extensions,
 and some specialized modules.
