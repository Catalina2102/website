# Repertorium of Old Bulgarian Literature and Letters




* URL: <http://repertorium.obdurodon.org/>



Description:
 The , based at 
 the Institute of Literature of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, was conceived as
 an
 archival repository capable of encoding and preserving in SGML (and,
 subsequently, XML) format archeographic, palaeographic, codicological,
 textological, and literary-historical data concerning original and
 translated medieval texts represented in Balkan and other Cyrillic manuscripts. The
 files are intended to serve both as documentation (fulfilling the goals of
 traditional manuscript catalogues) and as direct input for
 computer-assisted philological research.
