Description:
 DWDS is a digital lexical system developed by and hosted at the BBAW. The system offers
 one-click-access to three different types of resources: a) lexical resources: a common
 language
 dictionary, an etymological dictionary, and a thesaurus; b) corpus resources: a balanced
 reference corpus
 (called “DWDS core corpus”) of German ranging from 1900 up to now, a set
 of additional newspaper corpora, and specialized corpora and c) statistical resources
 for words and word
 combinations. These resources are displayed alongside one another in separate
 panels; the system offers the choice among several views, i.e. between several profiles
 with predefined
 panel combinations.



Implementation description:
 For our corpora, we use the “default text” module of TEI P5. For our 
 lexical resources we use the "printed dictionaries" module of TEI P5 with some slight
 modifications. For an
 upcoming corpus of (German) computer-mediated communication we are currently customising
 the “default
 text module”. We will publish the schema and documentation soon. We are currently
 providing metadata for
 all our resources in TEI style as well.
 



Access:
 In general, open access. We have to heed to contracts with our corpus providers, which
 makes
 the situation less easy in practice.
