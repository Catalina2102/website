Description:


The of the University of
 Alicante in Spain ("
 Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de
 Cervantes") covers many different cultural and academic
 subjects.


Our books are basically public domain Hispanic
 classics written or published between the twelfth century and the
 nineteenth century, but some contemporary works are also included.
 Genres of these books include prose, drama, verse, dictionaries,
 history, and others. The books were encoded in digital form
 using the TEI markup scheme and the XML markup language. The
 digital texts, which are the vast majority of the library works,
 are easily accessible in HTML format through the Internet. HTML
 files are produced automatically from our TEI-XML source files by
 means of XSL transformations.


The library is meant for a wide audience covering different
 ages, interests and cultures. Apart from the Hispanic classics,
 the library includes such diverse resources as digitised cultural
 magazines>,
 a library
 for children, and academic research resources such as [PhD theses](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/tesis/tesis_catalogo.shtml).
 In addition, the digital library has whole sections devoted to many renowned
 academic institutions and national libraries of Latin America, who
 have contributed their valuable funds to our library for digitisation.
 These sections are meant to preserve and promote minority
 Hispanic-related languages, and to affirm different Hispanic
 cultures. The design of these sections does not only entail the
 use of new techniques, but also involves collaboration agreements
 whereby staff from the travel
 to other centres, universities, and institutions all around
 different areas of Spain and Latin America in order to digitise
 the documents, objects, and works of art that will be finally
 published on the library main server. After some training, staff
 from the contributing institutions begin to digitise and correct
 the texts which are finally marked-up, supervised, processed, and
 published in Spain.



History:



The project began in late 1998 with a small team of 5 people
 performing preliminary trial and error tests to determine the
 viability of the project and to find the most adequate production
 methods and tools. After this initial phase, massive digital book
 production started in March 1999, with about 80 persons working on
 digitisation and correction of texts and a small team of computer
 technicians mounting the computer infrastructure, developing
 automatic tools for efficient production and designing the
 publication processes and the web site. The library was opened to
 the Internet public in July 1999 with approximately 800 books. By
 July 2001, we had reached 5000 entries in the catalogue.


Between 100 to 120 university graduates and technicians
 permanently work in this project as librarians, scanner operators,
 correctors, mark-up specialists, and computer technicians.


Since the opening of this digital library in 1999, about
 70,000,000 accesses have been received in the first two years.
 Currently, the average number of pages served is
 21,000 daily. 71% of our users are from Spanish speaking countries (Spain
 and Latin America), 6% from the rest of Europe, and 23% from the rest of the
 world.



Financial support: 



The is the result of a
 unique collaboration between the [University of
 Alicante](http://www.ua.es/) and Spain's biggest bank, the Banco
 Santander Central Hispano, who have joined forces to create the world's biggest
 digital library containing Spanish works.


It represents an
 example of a successful partnership between university and
 business, with the Santander Central Hispano bank providing
 complete sponsorship for the full development of the project.


The University, on the other hand, provides the academic
 expertise, technological know-how, and qualified workforce
 necessary to fulfill the objectives and ensures the international
 use of the Library's resources by means of collaboration
 agreements with universities and institutions all over the
 world.



Multilinguality:



The library collection focuses on Hispanic literature, history
 and culture, in various Hispanic languages such as Catalan, Basque,
 and Galician, or Latin-American native languages as Quechua,
 Mapuche, or Guaraní in addition to Spanish.


Some of our present multicultural sections include: the [Library of
 Catalunya](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BC/) and the [Joan Luis
 Vives](http://lluisvives.com/) Institute, both with works in Catalan language, country-specific
 collections as the [National
 Library of Chile](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BNC/), the [National
 Library of Argentina](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BNA/) , the College
 of Mexico, the [José A.
 Portuondo Valdor Institute of Literature and Linguistics](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/ILL/) of
 Cuba, and the section about [Paraguayan
 Literature](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/paraguay/).


The library also features thematic portals such as [DOXA](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/DOXA/),
 about the philosophy of law, [Hispano-American

 History](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/), and a section on [Geographic
 Research](http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/IIGG/).


Other important sections of this digital library, under the
 title of Authors'
 Libraries, are special collections dedicated to selected
 world-renowned Hispanic authors . They consist of personalized web
 pages describing their life and works with links to their digital
 books within the library as well as to external resources.
 Manuscripts and special valuable documents of the authors (like
 drawings, photographs, book covers, and personal letters) are
 usually provided. In the case of contemporary authors, videos and
 audio recordings give a closer appreciation of their
 personality.



Aims:



The hopes to act as a
 vehicle for the Hispanic academy to promote their works, as a
 window to Hispanic literature and culture for scholars of Hispanic
 languages, and as a voice for the Hispanic community worldwide
 meant to reach an international multiracial and multilingual
 student and academic community of Internet users.


The aims to become the most
 ambitious project of digitisation of Spanish works through the
 application of new methods of electronic publication for mass
 documental information.
