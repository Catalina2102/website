General description: Created by the Indiana General Assembly
 in 1820, the Board of Trustees is Indiana University's
 governing board, legal owner, and final authority. The
 board holds the university's financial, physical, and
 human assets and operations in trust for future
 generations. Its membership, terms of office,
 responsibilities, powers, and electoral procedures are
 governed by the Indiana State Code. The current
 nine-member board meets nine times a year on various
 campuses around the state.
 

 The Trustees minutes includes official acts,
 resolutions, policies, agreements, and other business
 records pertaining to the governance of Indiana
 University. Also found are Administrative Action
 Reports (AAR) which were first included with the
 minutes in November 1987. Many of the minutes on this
 site include AAR, but some do not. Please contact the
 board office (855-3762) if you wish to request a copy
 of an AAR.
 

 This web site is the result of a cooperative project
 between the Indiana University Digital Library Program,
 Office of University Archives and Records Management
 and the Board of Trustees office to provide access to a
 growing number of meeting minutes on the web. The
 Archives houses the official paper copies of the
 minutes from 1835 to the present, except 1859-1883
 which were destroyed in the campus fire of 1883 at the
 former location of Indiana University at Seminary
 Square.



Implementation description:
 The process for encoding the most recent
 minutes involves copying and pasting Microsoft Word
 files into the XML editor <oXygen/>, and encoding
 the documents according to the Text Encoding Initiative
 (TEI) Guidelines (version P4). About 20 years of
 minutes, August 1981-December 2001, were converted from
 HTML to XML files by a vendor, and were subjected to a
 quality check to ensure consistency with the project
 team's encoding decisions. Minutes pre-dating August
 1981 are scanned using FineReader Optical Character
 Recognition (OCR) software to convert them to text
 files before encoding them in TEI. As encoding
 progresses, this site will be updated with a goal to
 eventually include all existing sets of minutes from
 1835 to the present.
