Partners:


 Project partners include the Research Council of
 Norway, the universities of Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø, The Sør-Trøndelag
 University College, and The National Library of Norway. The publication of the
 resultant edition is financially supported by The Arts Council Norway and The
 Norwegian Archives, Libraries and Museums Authority. 



Description:


 A new complete historical-critical and commented edition of Henrik Ibsen's writings,
 printed and unprinted, is in progress. It will comprise plays, poems, articles,
 lectures, letters, drafts and notes. The edition will be published both
 electronically and in book form. The book edition will consist of 30 volumes:
 fifteen volumes of text and fifteen volumes of commentaries. 


In addition to the texts, introductions, and commentaries in the printed edition,
 the
 electronic edition will include transcriptions of all known manuscripts and all
 printed versions from Ibsen's lifetime, as well as transcribed scores of Ibsen's
 musical dramas and compositions for his poems. His entire textual production, from
 the first word on paper to the last printed edition before 1906, is to be
 documented. The electronic texts will be encoded with a view to a wide range of
 search, allowing the user to move back and forth between various stages of a work's
 genesis. Pointers to secondary literature will be installed. 


The database is planned to contain digitalized pictures pertaining to the playwright
 and his work. There will also be links to facsimiles of all known manuscript
 material in Ibsen's hand, and to his own drawings and paintings.
