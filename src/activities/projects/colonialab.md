 General description: is an experimental workshop for the collaborative electronic
 edition of manuscript and rare print texts related to colonial Latin America. seeks
 to produce high–quality textual scholarship, pose theoretical and practical questions
 related to the edition of colonial–era texts, and develop strategies for preparing
 a new generation of Humanities scholars to engage with the complex textual history
 of Latin America. currently has three active projects: an interactive edition of a
 seventeenth–century Spanish bibliography of books about the Indies, an documentary
 variorum edition of an eighteenth–century text dealing with Spanish expeditions to
 present–day British Columbia, and an digital archive of key documents related to a
 late seventeenth–century English expedition to Chile. These projects all involve undergraduate
 students from the University of North Florida as transcribers, TEI-XML encoders and
 editorial assistants.
 
 Implementation description:
 We are preparing documentary editions accompanied by partially modernized reading
 texts, and so are using many of TEI elements that serve for manuscript description,
 as well as elements such as <choice> that allow us to encode transcriptions and regularized
 versions together as unitary TEI texts. We are also experimenting with the use of
 TEI for the encoding of historical print bibliographies, and are developing an approach
 to marking up key semantic aspects of Early Modern nautical texts.
