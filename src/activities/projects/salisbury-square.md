**General description**: A prolific author of the 'Salisbury Square School,' James Malcolm Rymer (1814-84) is credited with inventing the enduring pseudo-historical villain Sweeney Todd. Rymer also made major interventions in British fictional representations of nautical life and Victorian transoceanic imperialism. The digital instantiation of Salisbury Square consists of open access, accessible, annotated digital documentary editions of selected fiction by and/or attributed to Rymer and his coteries, beginning with the 1850-1 String of Pearls. This edition is currently unfinished and in rough draft form.
