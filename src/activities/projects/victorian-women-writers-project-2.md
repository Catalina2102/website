# Victorian Women Writers Project




* Host: Indiana University
* URL: <http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/vwwp/>
* Main language: English



General description: The 
 (VWWP) was begun in 1995 at Indiana University under
 the determined leadership and editorship of Perry
 Willett. The VWWP was celebrated early on for exposing
 lesser-known British women writers of the 19th century,
 writers whose popularity did not make the transition
 into the 20th century or inclusion in a literary canon.
 Originally the VWWP focused on poetry, but soon Willett
 acknowledged the variety of genres in which women of
 that period were writing—novels, children’s books,
 political pamphlets, religious tracts and so on. Thus
 the collection was expanded to include genres beyond
 poetry and so the VWWP grew until about the turn of the
 twenty-first century, ultimately including
 approximately two hundred texts as part of the
 corpus.
 

 Quiet since 2003, the VWWP is pleased to be back with
 an expanded purview that includes women writing in the
 nineteenth century in English beyond Britain. As
 before, the project will devote time and attention to
 the accuracy and completeness of the texts, as well as
 to their bibliographical descriptions. New texts,
 encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
 P5 Guidelines, will adopt principles of scholarly
 encoding, facilitating more sophisticated retrieval and
 analysis.



Implementation description:
 The approximately 200 original, online
 texts that are currently part of the Victorian Women
 Writers Project (VWWP) were produced by transcription
 and originally encoded in the Standard Generalized
 Markup Language (SGML) following the Text Encoding
 Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, version P3, using the TEI
 Lite DTD (version 1.6).
 

 In an effort to bring the encoding up to date, the
 original SGML, TEI P3 files were transformed to XML,
 TEI P4. Aspects of the encoding that were not conducive
 to automatic mapping and transformation were updated
 manually. In 2009, the TEI P4 version of the files were
 transformed yet again to the most current version of
 the TEI P5, which also required manual intervention to
 address aspects lost in translation, and also to
 conform to the newly revised Best Practices for TEI in
 Libraries. The VWWP texts now rely on a custom W3C
 schema.
