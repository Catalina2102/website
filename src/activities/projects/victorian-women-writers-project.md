# Victorian Women Writers' Project

Description:


The goal of the Victorian Women Writers Project is to
 produce highly accurate transcriptions of works by British
 women writers of the 19th century, encoded using the Standard
 Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The works, selected with
 the assistance of the Advisory Board, will include
 anthologies, novels, political pamphlets, religious tracts,
 children's books, and volumes of poetry and verse
 drama. Considerable attention will be given to the accuracy
 and completeness of the texts, and to accurate
 bibliographical descriptions of them.


Texts will be encoded according to the Text Encoding
 Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, using the TEILite.DTD (version
 1.6) We will include with each text a header describing fully
 the source text, the editorial decisions, and the resulting
 computer file. The texts will be made freely available
 through the World Wide Web.


About 200 texts are currently available; they can be
 downloaded in either HTML or SGML. The site also includes
 information on works in preparation and proposed works.
