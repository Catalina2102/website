# Ɛpsilon



**Host:** Cambridge University Library
**URL:** <https://epsilon.ac.uk>

**Description:**
ƐPSILON is a collaborative digital framework for nineteenth century letters of science
 being developed by the Darwin Correspondence Project in collaboration with Cambridge
 University Digital Library. It is an initial step in providing a technical infrastructure
 to allow us to start to recreate the complex world of nineteenth century correspondence,
 joining multiple collections for cross-searching. The initial launch of ƐPSILON features
 eight collections, accounting for 45,000 letters and reflecting a variety of source
 materials. The data of each project that contributes to ƐPSILON is converted into
 TEI P5 and served up in an XTF instance. So far we have incorporated a mix of active
 projects with long-standing digital editions, finished projects whose work has existed
 only in print, and metadata from correspondence catalogues. We hope ultimately to
 be able to host small deposits of letters from individual scholars as well as work
 from larger correspondence projects.
