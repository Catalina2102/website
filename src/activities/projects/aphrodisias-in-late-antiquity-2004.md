 A digital edition of 250 inscriptions from the Greek city of Aphrodisias, all dating
 from the Late Antique period (4th-10th Centuries A.D.); expanded and enhanced version
 of the 1989 printed book by Charlotte Roueché. This is primarily an academic resource,
 but the provision of full translations and indices makes it suitable for teaching
 also.

 Narrative materials conform to a standard TEI P4 DTD. The inscriptions themselves
 are encoded according to the EpiDoc guidelines and DTD (<http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/>).
