# Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association



 
 


**Description:** In the last years, through the contribution of many people, a large number of Buddhist
 sutras appeared on electronic networks, this was due to a feverish wave of input of
 electronic Buddhist scriptures. The goal of everybody was to make this available on
 the network for free use, so these files have been made available for download free
 of charge through FTP, or for convenient browsing through GOPHER or the World-Wide
 Web. More recently, it has even become possible to do simple searches of Buddhist
 texts on the Web. The next step was to put these files together to form electronic
 books and make the appearance on the screen more attractive. All those who put effort
 in this hoped to increase the availability of Buddhist scriptures on the net to let
 more people come in contact with the teachings of Buddhism and to use the means of
 computers and networks to open up a new way of reading the sutras.
