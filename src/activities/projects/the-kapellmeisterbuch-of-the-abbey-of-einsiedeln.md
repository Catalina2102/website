General description: The Benedicine Abbey of Einsiedeln
 in Switzerland holds a uncommon handwritten music
 inventory, the Kapellmeisterbuch, in which each
 piece of music performed at the abbey on Sundays
 and other feasts between 1813 and 1852, and
 fragmentary from 1805 to 1884, were registered by
 the Kapellmeister. The book, which contains about
 340 pages, is an unique document and an extremely
 valuable resource for musicologists for the study
 of the musical life in the 19th century in
 Switzerland.



Implementation description:
 A TEI transcription (P5) of the
 Kapellmeisterbuch enabled the creation of different
 indexes, which provide the user with browsing by
 date, by composer and by liturgical feast. The
 indexes contain normalised versions of the names
 appearing in the document.
 

 In the transcription, the doubtfulness and the
 completions of the abbreviations were integrated
 according to the TEI guidelines for simple
 editorial changes. The text of the transcription
 can be searched using a full-text approach.
 

 In the web application, the transcription is linked
 to digital images of the manuscript available at
 high-resolution.
