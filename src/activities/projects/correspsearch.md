**Description:**


With correspSearch you may search within the metadata of diverse digital
or printed scholarly editions of letters. The web service assembles and
analyses files in the "Correspondence Metadata Interchange format“
(CMIF) that has been developed by the TEI Correspondence Special
Interest Group ([http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SIG/Correspondence/](https://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SIG/Correspondence/)).


Apart from a website, correspSearch provides also an API which allows
for automatic requests to the web service (the aggregated data is
available under a free license). The API is also used by the JavaScript
widget "csLink", which refers from an edited letter in your own digital
edition to temporally adjacent letters of the correspondence partners
from other editions. The Widget "csLink" is available on
<https://github.com/correspSearch/csLink>.


Scholarly editions are encouraged to provide their indexes of letters in
the CMIF for this web service. Interested scholars will find information
on the website on how to participate as well as the "CMIF Creator",
which enables the convenient, form-based creation of CMIF files of
printed editions - even without technical knowledge.


Together with the TEI element correspDesc and the Correspondence
Metadata Interchange Format, the Webservice correspSearch was awarded
2018 with the "Rahtz Prize for TEI Ingenuity".
