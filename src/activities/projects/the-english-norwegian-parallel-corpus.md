Description:


"The aim of the project is (1) to compile corpora of parallel texts in different languages
 and prepare them for computer processing; (2) to develop tools for analysing parallel
 texts; and (3) to carry out studies of the structure and communicative use of the
 languages based on the corpus.


 consists of extracts of 10,000–15,000 words from English and Norwegian original texts
 and their translations (English to Norwegian and Norwegian to English). There are
 100 English texts and 100 Norwegian texts aligned at the sentence level, in all approximately
 2.6 million words. The texts are encoded in accordance with the TEI conventions (see
 the [ENPC manual](http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/forskning/forskningsprosjekter/enpc/ENPCmanual.html) for details). An automatic alignment program has been produced by Knut Hofland, Norwegian
 Computing Centre for the Humanities, Bergen, and a browser by Jarle Ebeling, Department
 of British and American Studies, University of Oslo.


When the English-Norwegian Parallel Corpus was completed, work began to include other
 languages, mainly German, Dutch, and Portuguese. The extension of the corpus to include
 other languages, especially German, later resulted in a new project, Languages in
 Contrast, and a new corpus, called the [Oslo Multilingual Corpus](/Activities/Projects/os01.xml). The texts in the new corpus, which also includes French, are aligned at sentence
 level and are encoded according to the TEI conventions.


Because of copyright restrictions, the corpora cannot be distributed to researchers
 outside the universities of Oslo and Bergen."
