General description: The Walters Art Museum is committed to digitizing its collection of nearly 1000
 manuscripts, most of which date back to medieval times. Almost all of these manuscripts
 are illuminated, containing intricate paintings or hand-drawn diagrams and charts.
 Each manuscript is digitized in its entirety; we image all folios/pages, any bookmarks
 that may be found within, and the bindings. Complete, in-depth cataloguing is done
 by experts around the world which is then published in the TEI format.
 
The project began in 2008 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities
 (NEH), allowing us to digitize 120 Islamic manuscripts dating from the 9th to the
 19th centuries. This was followed by a second NEH grant which aided the digitization
 of a group of 105 under-cataloged manuscripts with English, Dutch, German, Armenian,
 Byzantine, Ethiopian, and Spanish origins. In 2013, we began digitizing 112 medieval
 Flemish books of hours (personal books of prayer and devotion) with funding from a
 third NEH grant. As of April 1, 2015, this manuscript digitization project has been
 folded into the daily operations of the Walters Art Museum, and the imaging of French
 and Italian manuscripts is slated to commence in September 2015.
 
We publish all of our images and metadata on thedigitalwalters.org under a Creative
 Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. This license ensures that anyone
 can study, publish, and enjoy our digitized manuscripts free of charge. Currently
 over 120,000 high resolution images are available, along with complete cataloguing
 information in the TEI format and human-readable HTML. Further information regarding
 our use of TEI can be found at http://thedigitalwalters.org/Supplemental/ManuscriptDescription.html.
