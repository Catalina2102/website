# The Orlando Project: An Integrated History of Women's Writing in the British Isles








* Host: University of Alberta
* URL: <http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/orlando/>



Description:



The Orlando Project is creating a textbase of research on women's history 
 and literary history in the British Isles. Our project differs from other 
 TEI-based projects in that we are using SGML to tag text that 1) does not 
 currently exist, 2) is notable for its subject matter as well as its 
 structure, and 3) is critical and interpretive in nature.



– Sharon Balazs, 16 Jul 2000



Funding and Personnel:


The Orlando Project was initially funded by the Social Sciences and 
 Humanities Research Council of Canada. It is currently funded by the 
 Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Universities of Alberta and 
 Guelph. Project Director is Dr. Patricia Clements, University of Alberta; 
 principal co-investigators are Drs. Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy, 
 University of Alberta; co-investigators are Dr. Susan Brown, University of 
 Guelph and Dr. Renée Elio, University of Alberta. Principal technical work 
 on the SGML/TEI aspects of the project is being done by Sharon Balazs and
