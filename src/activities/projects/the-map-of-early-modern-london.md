General description: Role of the Project: The Map of
 Early Modern London is comprised of four distinct,
 interoperable projects: a digital Map and gazetteer based on
 the 1560s Agas woodcut map of London; an Encyclopedia of
 London people, places, topics, and terms; a Library of
 marked-up texts rich in London toponyms; and a versioned
 edition of John Stow’s Survey of London.
 

 These four projects draw data from MoEML’s five databases: a
 Placeography of locations (e.g., streets, sites, playhouses,
 taverns, churches, wards, and topographical features); a
 Personography of early modern Londoners, both historical and
 literary; an Orgography of organizations (e.g., livery
 companies and other corporations); a Bibliography of primary
 and secondary sources; and a Glossary of terms relevant to
 early modern London. All of the files in our databases use a
 common TEI tagset that enables us to work with primary and
 secondary texts simultaneously.
 

 Audience: primarily researchers of early modern London
 (history, English, geo-humanities), though many of our users
 come from the general public
 

 Scope of the TEI resources created and their coverage: Our
 site uses TEI for both our born-digital content and our
 editions of primary texts. We offer born-digital content in
 the form of Encyclopedia articles (on people, places, topics,
 and terms) on early modern London. We also transcribe and
 produce primary-source literary texts, including the London
 lord mayor's shows, prose, verse, dramatic extracts, and an
 edition of John Stow's "Survey of London" with all people,
 places, and dates marked up.



Implementation description:
 We use TEI tagsets for names, dates,
 people, and places extensively. We also use tagsets for
 verse, transcriptions, certainty, precision, and
 responsibility.
 
 Our programmer, Martin Holmes, is on the TEI Technical
 Council.
