Description:
 The objective of "" is to provide critically-edited scholarly texts for works of
 fiction and social criticism by the most important American author in the first half
 of the 19th century. James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851), more than anyone else in
 his time, created a succession of works raising fundamental questions about a distinctive
 American identity. As a professional author, Cooper worked hard to improve the texts
 of his work, which (especially early in his career) suffered from egregious errors
 in the press. The Cooper Edition thus documents Cooper's attention to improving his
 texts whenever opportunities arose for him to correct editions after the first. 



Implementation description:
 The Cooper Edition has published 18 texts as of 2002. All new editorial projects
 after that date will use TEI procedures in preparing the scholarly editions. Our
 intent is that the Edition will be able to make available electronically materials
 not previously part of printed texts, such as long cancellations.



Other Related Resources:
 We are just beginning to learn the TEI protocols and procedures.



Access :
 Copyright is vested with the Edition's publishers, SUNY Press (1980-1991) and AMS
 Press (2002 on). Cooper Edition texts are also available in paper backs for class
 room use through Penguin and Oxford University presses. No authorized electronic
 versions are presently available.
