General description: will
 provide the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley,
 Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary
 Wollstonecraft, bringing together online for the first time
 ever the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely
 gifted family of writers. The result of a partnership between
 the New York Public Library and the Maryland Institute for
 Technology in the Humanities, in cooperation with Oxfordâ€™s
 Bodleian Library, the S-GA also includes key contributions
 from the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the
 Houghton Library. In total, these partner libraries contain
 over 90% of all known relevant manuscripts.



Implementation description:
 The technical infrastructure of the
 Shelley-Godwin Archive builds on linked data principles and
 emerging standards such as the Shared Canvas data model and
 the Text Encoding Initiative's Genetic Editions vocabulary.
 It is designed to support a participatory platform where
 scholars, students, and the general public will be able to
 engage in the curation and annotation of the Archive's
 contents.
 

 is one of the early adopters of
 this new module of the TEI, as is particularly fitting for a
 manuscript archive. Transcribers record the appearance of the
 text on the page, as well as identify authorial revisions or
 even interventions by different hands, an especially
 important distinction in those manuscripts where Mary and
 Percy Shelley worked together. This type of encoding enables
 the presentation of multiple views of the text on the fly,
 including diplomatic transcriptions faithful to the page
 image, a clear reading text showing the end result of
 revisions to each page, and text written only by Mary or
 Percy Shelley.
