Description:
 The original purpose of the corpus was to create a general frequency dictionary of
 contemporary Polish. The work started in 1967. Partial results were published between
 1972 and 1977, the completed dictionary in 1990. The corpus was later augmented in
 various respects, both by manual editing and automated procedures.
 
 Corpus data contain 10,000 samples divided into 5 parts: essays, news, scientific
 texts, fiction and plays. Every sample is approximately 50 words long, they all come
 from texts published between 1963 and 1967 and contain bibliographic description of
 its source. Each word is tagged with its base form and some morphological properties.
 Sentence boundaries are also marked.
