Description:



Cædmon's Hymn is the first scholarly edition of the poem in more than 60 years. It is based on
 new TEI encoded transcriptions of all known manuscripts, and will include colour facsimiles
 as permission is acquired. The final stage of the editing process, the construction
 of multiple mediated (i.e. critical) views is currently underway. The text is provisionally
 scheduled for publication with the Society for Early English and Norse Electronic
 Texts (SEENET) at the University of Michigan Press under the Series editor, Hoyt N.
 Duggan.
