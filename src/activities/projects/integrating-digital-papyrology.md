Description:
 A digital corpus of 55 000 (mostly Greek) papyrological texts (from the Duke Databank
 of Documentary Papyri) aggregated with 65000 metadata records (from the Heidelberger
 Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen Papyrusurkunden Ã„gyptens). Texts are from the Ptolemaic,
 Roman, and Byzantine periods, and are delivered through the Papyrological Navigator
 (http://papyri.info/).
 A user-friendly tags-free interface for authoring and editing the TEI content and
 controlling the workflow is in use by hundreds of 
 users worldwide: <http://papyri.info/editor/>.



Implementation description:
 Texts and metadata are encoded according to the EpiDoc Guidelines for encoding ancient
 epigraphical and papyrological texts in TEI (<http://epidoc.sf.net/>).
