General description: The Dickinson Archive is an
 open-access repository of all known original manuscripts of
 poetry by Emily Dickinson. High-resolution images of the
 manuscript pages are available, with complete
 transcriptions from several editions. The primary intended
 audience is literary scholars seeking access to the
 original manuscripts. Dickinson's papers are scattered in
 several collections, and like many historical archives,
 physical access is extremely limited due to age and
 fragility of the materials. Secondarily, students and
 casual readers seeking greater depth of understanding of
 Dickinson's intent in her writing. One TEI file was created
 for each published transcript, which are downloadable from
 the website.



Implementation description:
 Primarily we relied on the verse
 and critical apparatus modules. The main complexity of the
 coding was in accurately capturing the various emendations
 made to the manuscripts by Dickinson herself as well as
 editorial changes made in the transcripts. No modifications
 were made to the schema.
