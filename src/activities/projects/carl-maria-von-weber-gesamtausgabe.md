 **Description:** The Collected Works of Carl Maria von Weber (WeGA) is a venture funded by the German
 Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Mainz). Its main objective is a complete scholarly
 edition of Weber’s compositions, letters, diaries and writings up to his 200th birthday
 in 2026. The edition will approximately comprise 50 volumes of score including critical
 reports, 10 volumes of letters, approx. 8 volumes of diaries, 2 volumes writings,
 a catalogue as well as multiple volumes of documents. All textual parts (i.e. exclusive
 of scores) are encoded in TEI P5 and are being published as digital edition on the
 project's website in the first instance.
 
 **Implementation description:** We are developing our own TEI customisations for various types of texts, e.g. diaries,
 letters, biographies with TEI ODD.
 
 These ODD files (and the generated schemas) are available from GitHub (<https://github.com/Edirom/WeGA-ODD>). Our own web application for presenting the digital edition is built on eXist-db
 and available from GitHub (<https://github.com/Edirom/WeGA-WebApp>), as well.
