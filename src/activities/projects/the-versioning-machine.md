# The Versioning Machine




* Host: University of Maryland
* URL: <http://v-machine.org>



Description: is a software tool designed by
 a team of programmers, designers, and literary scholars for displaying and comparing
 multiple versions of texts. The display environment provides for features traditionally
 found in codex-based critical editions, such as annotation and introductory material,
 while taking advantage of opportunities of electronic publishing, such as providing
 a
 frame to compare diplomatic versions of witnesses side by side, allowing for
 manipulatable images of the witness to be viewed alongside the diplomatic edition,
 and
 providing users with an enhanced typology of notes.
