General description: Designed to be of interest to the general
 public as well as to academic researchers, the St Patrick’s
 Confessio Hypertext Stack includes such features as digital
 images of the medieval manuscripts involved, a specially
 commissioned historical reconstruction that evocatively
 describes life in pre-Viking Ireland, audio presentations,
 and some ten thousand internal and external digital links
 that make it truly a resource to be explored. The Stack,
 which has been funded for three years under the Irish
 government’s Programme for Research in Third-Level
 Institutions (Cycle Four), provides free access to a piece
 of heritage that can be claimed by the most diverse
 components of Irish society.
 




Implementation description:
 TEI encoded resources comprise:
 
 - a deeply encoded critical text with apparatus notes
 (encoded as notes, not using the apparatus criticus
 tagset!) and LinkGrp's in order to align the original Latin
 with the facsimiles of all extant manuscripts copies and a
 variety of prints;
 
 - manuscript descriptions;
 
 - translations into English, Irish, Portuguese and
 German;
 
 - several essays and articles;
 
 - a novel
