General description: An interactive tutorial in 
 scansion,
 or the metrical and rhythmic analysis of stress
 patterns within traditional verse in English. In the
 first instance the audience is students learning
 scansion in an English class (university or secondary
 school), but the site is designed to stand alone for
 use by a learner anywhere. The several dozen poems in
 the site are marked up with TEI P5 coding, especially
 subsection 6 on Verse. We introduced slight
 modification of the marking of syllable divisions
 within a word but chiefly followed the TEI
 protocols.
