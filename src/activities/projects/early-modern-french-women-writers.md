Description:


Working with faculty and students in the
 departments of French & Italian and History, the Electronic Text Research
 Center has developed an initiative to digitize texts by women writers in
 Early Modern France. At present we focus on women writers of the
 15th-17th centuries. Our early list has included Christine de Pizan,
 Diane de Poitiers, Louise Labé, Madeleine de Scudéry, Marguerite de
 Navarre, Marie de Gournay, and Pernette du Guillet; we also have a
 working list of 16 other women writers from the period.
