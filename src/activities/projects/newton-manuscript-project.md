# Newton Manuscript Project




* Host: University of Sussex
* URL: <http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/prism.php?id=1>



Description:
 The Newton Project website aims to bring together in a single resource a high-quality
 electronic facsimile edition of Newton's papers, consisting of digital facsimile manuscript
 images alongside facing page text-encoded transcriptions on a split screen. Initially
 we are concentrating on the non-scientific material (including Newton's theological,
 alchemical and administrative writings), but aim ultimately to include all the documents
 Newton produced, including working notes and draft variants. Facsimile images will
 be stored in a high-resolution standard lossless image format (e.g. TIFF). In addition
 to the images and transcripts, hyperlink access will be provided to our own critical
 apparatus, and to online versions of source material, translations, indexes, bibliographies,
 articles, morphological analysers, Greek and Latin lexicons, search tools and related
 sites. This will greatly enhance the ability to access, interpret and analyse these
 manuscripts in their historical context. Our website will not only give the reader
 a means of understanding Newton's intellectual development, but will be linked to
 a much larger international digital library initiative to create Web-based resources
 for the study of early modern science and philosophy.
