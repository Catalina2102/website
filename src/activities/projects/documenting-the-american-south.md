Description:


" (DAS), an electronic collection sponsored by the Academic Affairs Library at the
 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, provides access to digitized primary
 materials that offer Southern perspectives on American history and culture. It supplies
 teachers, students, and researchers at every educational level with a wide array of
 titles they can use for reference, studying, teaching, and research.


Currently, DAS includes several digitization projects: slave narratives, first-person
 narratives, Southern literature, Confederate imprints, and materials related to the
 church in the black community. Another project featuring North Caroliniana is in development.


All the selected texts are encoded according to the TEI Guidelines, using TEI Lite.DTD
 (1.6). Digitized texts receive individual full-level MARC catalog records, created
 through the OCLC system."
