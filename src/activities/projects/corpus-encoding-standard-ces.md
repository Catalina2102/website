# Corpus Encoding Standard (CES)








* Host: Vassar College Department of Computer Science
* URL: <http://www.cs.vassar.edu/CES/>



Description:



[MULTEXT](http://www.lpl.univ-aix.fr/projects/multext/), along with EAGLES and the [Vassar/CNRS](http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~ide/research/) collaboration (supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation), have developed
 a Corpus Encoding Standard that will "serve as a widely accepted set of encoding standards
 for corpus-based work... The CES is specifies a minimal encoding level that corpora
 must achieve to be considered standardized in terms of descriptive representation
 (marking of structural and typographic information) as well as general architecture
 (so as to be maximally suited for use in a text database). It also provides encoding
 specifications for linguistic annotation, together with a data architecture for linguistic
 corpora." The CES is available in SGML, and XML.
