Description:


Early Canadiana Online (ECO) is a digital library providing
 access to over 937,800 pages of Canada's printed heritage. It
 features works published from the time of the first European
 settlers up to the early 20th Century. ECO is produced by the
 Canadian Institute for
 Historical Microreproductions (CIHM), a nonprofit
 organization for preserving and providing access to early
 Canadian publications, first on microfiche and now online.


ECO began in 1997 as a pilot project to create an online
 digital library. Over three years, 550,000 pages of text were
 taken from the CIHM's microfiche collection and scanned into
 digital images. The second phase of ECO began in 2000 and is
 scheduled to continue to 2004. During this time, 1,250,000 pages
 of colonial, federal, and provincial government publications
 will be scanned and published.


Along the way, a few special projects have also been added to
 the collection. These include 20,000 pages of text detailing the
 history of Hudson's Bay Company, and 22,500 pages of Jesuit
 Relations texts, translated into English by Reuben
 Thwaites. These collections are also accessible to the general
 public.
