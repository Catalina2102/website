 * **Host:** Walters Art Museum
* **Other institutions involved:** Center for Hellenic Studies, Holy Cross, Furman University, RIT.
* **URL:** <http://archimedespalimpsest.net/>


**Description:** Earliest known copy of Archimedes Work with digital images and transcriptions of
 the only copies of Archimedes treatises The Method and Stomachion; the only copy in
 Greek of On Floating Bodies; and copies of the Equilibrium of Planes, Spiral Lines,
 The Measurement of the Circle, and Sphere and Cylinder. The program also made further
 discoveries, including ten pages of unique text by the fourth century B.C. Attic Greek
 orator Hyperides; six folios from a still unidentified unique Neo-Platonic philosophical
 text that may be commentaries on Aristotle; four folios from a liturgical book; and
 twelve pages from two other books, the text of which has yet to be deciphered.
 
 **Implementation description:** The Digital Palimpsest purposes are threefold:
 
 * Serve as the authoritative digital data set of images in a standardized format that
 meets the needs of users, information providers, archives and libraries.
* Provide derived information (i.e. transcriptions, processing information) in the context
 of digital images of the original manuscript in a single integrated package.
* Offer a standard product sustainable by users to which current or future contributors
 can add additional standardized information (e.g. alternate texts, image analyses
 or conservation information).


 The Digital Palimpsest incorporates registered images for each leaf, TEI P5 scholarly
 transcriptions that scholars initially created in various nonstandard formats, and
 associated standardized metadata. It includes 4,000 digital images in 12 spectral
 bands and 400 pages of transcriptions of the original writings in Greek of Archimedes
 and others.
 
 **Other Related Resources:** Scholars produced XML transcriptions of the Greek text from digital images using
 common tools and standards that conform to the Text Encoding Initiative P5 guidelines.
