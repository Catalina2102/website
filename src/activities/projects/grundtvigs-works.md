By 2030, the project will have published in scholarly editions the entire 37.000 printed pages covering about 1.000 individual literary works. The edition will include annotations and digital facsimiles of the original first editions. The texts are encoded in accordance with TEI P5. By mid-2019, the project has worked its way through about 32% of the material – roughly 12.000 pages.
