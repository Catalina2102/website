# CELT Project: The Corpus of Electronic Texts



**URL:** <https://celt.ucc.ie/>
**Description:** "The Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT) aims to produce an online database of historical
 and literary texts in the languages of Ireland past and present. Where copyright permits
 the texts can be searched, read on-screen, downloaded for later use, or printed out.
 The CELT project grew out of the joint involvement of the Department of History and
 the Computer Centre in a number of related text projects over many years."
 
 The texts are available in TEI P4 XML as well as in HTML in the browser. Many texts
 are now available in translation and well as their original English, French, Irish
 and Latin.
 
 The site is currently (Nov 2018) being redesigned to work in mobile devices.
