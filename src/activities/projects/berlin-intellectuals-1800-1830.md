**General description:** This edition has two main aims. The first
 one is to make texts available that have not been published
 so far or have only been partially published. The second
 aim is to use the newly published corpus to develop methods
 that can help describe the intellectual networks in Berlin
 at the beginning of the 19th century in a more accurate
 way.
