Description:


The Legacy National Tobacco Documents Library (LNTDL) offers
 integrated searching of tobacco industry documents previously
 released through disparate industry websites, which are slated to
 cease in 2008. Through support of the American Legacy Foundation,
 the LNTDL will maintain this data through a permanent, stable
 interface.


The searchable data in the LNTDL is comprised of index records, one
 per document, which were created by the tobacco industry. These
 records contain both descriptive information about the
 content-title, author, date, persons mentioned, and so forth-as
 well as information regarding litigation usage, case names, and
 the like. Note: the text of the document is not searched. This
 data was provided to the individual tobacco companies to the
 National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), and given to the
 UCSF Library to mount the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library.
