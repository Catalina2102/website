Description:
 CLiMB (Computational Linguistics for Metadata Building) aims to improve subject access
 to image collections through the use of computational linguistic techniques. CLiMB-2,
 under the leadership of Judith Klavans, is funded by the Mellon Foundation from 2005-2007.
 CLiMB-1, also funded by the Mellon Foundation, was based at Columbia University under
 Judith Klavans' direction, from 2002 to 2004.



Implementation description:
 Two art history survey texts were scanned and encoded in TEI Lite for use in testing
 the feasibility of using computational linguistic techniques to associate texts and
 images. A list of image (plates) in the text is produced, then for each image, one
 or more paragraphs is identified that can be a source of descriptive (subject matter)
 metadata for indexing the image.
