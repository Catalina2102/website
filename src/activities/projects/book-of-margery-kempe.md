# Book of Margery Kempe




* Host: Southeastern Louisiana
 University
* URL: <http://english.selu.edu/humanitiesonline/kempe>
* Main language: English



General description: Our project's goal is to publish,
 in collaboration with the British Library, a complete
 digital facsimile of the The 
 alongside a documentary edition that solves many of the
 problems when print is used to represent medieval
 manuscripts. Modern transcriptions of medieval manuscripts
 have always faced compromises in their attempts to
 translate scribal practices to conventional typefaces and
 to readers unfamiliar with these practices. Visitors to our
 site can, for the first time, see the text of The Book of
 Margery Kempe stripped of annotating hands or preserved
 with these annotating hands in individual layers. Visitors
 will also see direct transcriptions of medieval scribal
 practices including special characters, medieval
 punctuation, and abbreviations that transform or expand
 with a simple click (or tap), and scalable high‚Äêresolution
 facsimiles of the manuscript.
