Description:


"The EpiDoc collaborative is committed to developing a software and hardware-independent
 interchange specification for scholarly and educational editions of inscribed and
 incised
 texts in Greek, Latin and other languages emanating from the ancient Greek, Roman
 and nearby
 civilizations."


"The EpiDoc effort is open to participation by any interested individual, organization
 or project. It was started by Tom Elliott, Hugh Cayless and Amy Hawkins at the [University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill](http://www.unc.edu/) (U.S.A.),
 and is being carried forward simultaneously by the individuals and projects listed
 below. The focal point for EpiDoc collaboration and interaction is the [MARKUP discussion list](http://lsv.uky.edu/archives/markup.html), hosted by the
 [Stoa Consortium for Electronic Publication in the
 Humanities](http://www.stoa.org/), an organization which has lent indispensable resources and advice to the
 EpiDoc effort."
