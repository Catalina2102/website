General description: The mission of the Duxbury Online
 Historic Archive is to make available to researchers and
 the public historical information about the Town of
 Duxbury. Multiple organizations, including the Town,
 maintain custody of historical materials of interest to
 those researching the early American history of Plymouth
 Colony. The purpose of this archive is to catalog the
 various materials for electronic records searches, and to
 provide direct online access to selected works and
 resources.



Implementation description:
 As of February 2013 we are
 investigating applicability of TEI to the literary content
 (typically Duxbury authors or works about early Duxbury
 residents), and other documents that will be incorporated
 into the archive.
