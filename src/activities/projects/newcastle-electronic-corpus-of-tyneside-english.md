# Newcastle Electronic Corpus of                 Tyneside English




* Host: University of Newcastle

* Main language: English



General description: The (NECTE) is a corpus of dialect
 speech from Tyneside in North-East England. It is
 based on two pre-existing corpora, one of them
 collected in the late 1960s by the Tyneside
 Linguistic Survey (TLS) project, and the other in
 1994 by the Phonological Variation and Change in
 Contemporary Spoken English (PVC) project. NECTE
 amalgamates the TLS and PVC materials into a single
 Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)-conformant
 XML-encoded corpus and makes them available in a
 variety of aligned formats: digitized audio,
 standard orthographic transcription, phonetic
 transcription, and part-of-speech tagged. This
 website describes the NECTE corpus in detail, and
 makes it available to academic researchers,
 educationalists, the media in non-commercial
 applications, and organisations such as language
 societies and individuals with a serious interest
 in historical dialect materials.
