Description:
 This website contains the outcomes and developmental history of an international research
 project using XML. A sample file from the literary estate of the philosopher Ludwig
 Wittgenstein, known as MS101, containing philosophical and personal remarks from September
 1914, was converted to XML with reference to the TEI Guidelines. A series of XSL stylesheets
 were prepared for output in XHTML and PDF. Particular attention was given to how MS101
 could be hyperlinked to external resources, and how the complexity of these links
 could be controlled and filtered according to the interests of the user. The final
 outcomes illustrate how output files can be generated dynamically on demand according
 to user preferences.



Implementation description:
 The intended audience includes both philosophers and text encoders, but also anyone
 who has a principal interest in electronic publishing.
