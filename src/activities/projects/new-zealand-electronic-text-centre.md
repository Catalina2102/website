Description:
 The NZETC operates with a threefold mission:
 


* to create a sustainable, optimally usable, and free online library of New Zealand
 and Pacific Island texts and materials;
* to create a community skilled in the use and creation of digital materials through
 training and faculty projects;
* to effectively partner with other organisations as a collaborator and as a service
 provider.


Following upon these ideals, NZETC hosts an ever-expanding free internet archive of
 standards-based and searchable TEI XML texts and images,



Implementation description:
 NZETC digitizes documents according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative
 (TEI). We deliver these documents and associated material using a semantic framework
 built from open source compenents and based around the ISO Topic Map technology.
 



 The NZETC employs Apache Cocoon internally to provide a publishing system allowing
 construction, management, and presentation of a TEI-encoded XML collection of texts,
 which is integrated in a Topic Map frame to produce a nationally important website
 containing more than 40,000 pages and over half-a-million hyperlinks. The use of Apache
 Cocoon allows the NZETC to easily provide multiple outputs (HTML, ePub, PDF, etc)
 from a single XML source file. Among other benefits of this system, the generation
 of such a large, well-interconnected website results in a high Google ranking for
 many of the subjects mentioned in the NZETC's collection. By harvesting not only bibliographic
 metadata but also references to people, organisations and places, the site provides
 individual pages for topics of interest, linked automatically to those places they
 are mentioned or illustrated. Being automatically generated from the source XML files,
 maintenance is simple and the number and types of topics linked to can be increased
 simply by adding extra mark-up to the texts.
