**Host:** Cambridge University Library

**Description:** 
The Darwin Correspondence Project is an independently funded research team, jointly
 managed by Cambridge University Library and the American Council of Learned Societies,
 and affiliated to the Department of History and Philosophy of Science in Cambridge.
  We locate and research letters written by and to the evolutionary scientist, Charles
 Darwin (1809–1882), and publish complete transcripts together with contextual notes
 and articles.  Darwin’s letters are an essential resource for understanding the development
 of his own ideas, and are an important source for the lives and work of more than
 2000 correspondents and others mentioned in the letters. A 30-volume print edition
 of The Correspondence of Charles Darwin (Cambridge University Press, 1985–), will
 be completed in 2022, and will contain more than 15000 letters, around 9000 of which
 are in Cambridge University Library’s Darwin Archive.  The letters are made available
 to read and search on our website four years after print publication.  Images of original
 letters are being incorporated through collaboration with Cambridge University Digital
 Library. All letter transcripts are edited in TEI P5.
