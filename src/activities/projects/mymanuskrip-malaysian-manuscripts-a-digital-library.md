General description: The objectives of MyManuskrip are: (a)
 to find out the current state of manuscript
 collection management and practices in selected
 libraries; (b) to identify the problems faced by
 manuscript repositories; (c) to study the metadata
 schema used by repositories to describe their
 manuscript collections, and (d) to identify a
 suitable open source digital library to support a
 digital library of manuscripts. The study gather
 qualitative data from an open ended questionnaire
 distributed to five manuscript librarians.
 Cataloguing practices by the manuscript
 repositories are observed and the open source
 digital library Greenstone was studied for
 suitability. The information gathered and observed
 helped determine the requirements of a digital
 library that empowers repositories in building,
 storing, preserving and disseminating information
 about manuscript collections is developed. Users
 are also empowered with better access options.
 Malay manuscripts are found in the Malay World,
 that is, the Malay Archipelago of Malaya, Borneo,
 Sumatra, Riau, and Indonesia. These items can also
 be found in repositories and Museums in the United
 Kingdom and the Netherlands. Detailed description
 of these manuscripts becomes essential to
 distinguish between the many versions of a single
 title held in various collections within Malaysia
 and abroad. No two manuscripts are alike. All these
 factors make cataloguing of manuscripts a
 challenging task. MyManuskrip aims to support a
 more detailed description and categorizations. It
 was found that the TEI meta tags are not found in
 the tag sets available in Greenstone. The TEI tag
 sets are added and used in the Greenstone digital
 library environment.



Implementation description:
 This project used a selection of the
 TEI metadata schema indicated by the tool ROMA. The
 TEI ROMA tool basically contains 63 fields, and
 MyManuskrip adopts 25 fields to describe Malay
 manuscripts.
