# Indiana Authors and Their Books

General description: (Indiana
 Authors) is an LSTA-funded project based on the digitization
 and encoding of the 3-volume reference work Indiana Authors
 and Their Books, which initially identified approximately 150
 monographs by selected authors from Indiana’s Golden Age of
 Literature (1880-1920). Since its original conception, the
 project grew in scope as a test-bed for "productionizing"
 e-text workflows in partnership with the Indiana University
 Bloomington Libraries Technical Services department. Another
 200 texts in the public domain, and, at the time not yet
 digitized as part of the Google Books initiative, were
 selected for electronic conversion. Although the encyclopedic
 3-volume reference work is at the center of this project, the
 online Indiana Authors resource is being launched in phases,
 with an initial focus on the encoded monographs that will be
 fully integrated with the encyclopedia by late Spring 2012.
 This newest release of the Indiana Authors project includes
 approximately 250 monographs.
 

 will provide students,
 educators, researchers, and the general public, in Indiana
 and throughout the world, with a searchable reference tool
 that will draw from unique state resources, link biographical
 sketches of famous Hoosier authors to full text electronic
 texts, and make Indiana’s rich literary history available
 online. A three-volume encyclopedia, Indiana Authors and
 Their Books, provides the framework for this project.
 Published over several decades, the comprehensive work
 attempts to include a biographical entry and a complete
 bibliography for all book authors who were born, raised, or
 educated in Indiana, or who lived in the state for a major
 portion of their lives. Among the 7,000 entries are many
 famous Hoosier authors from Indiana’s first 100 years of
 statehood, including Theodore Dreiser, Gene Stratton Porter,
 James Whitcomb Riley, and Booth Tarkington. The
 bio-bibliographic entries will link to digitized full-text
 editions of representative works by the most famous authors,
 and has provided a foundation for future development,
 including the addition of more full text editions by other
 Hoosier authors.



Implementation description:
 Of the approximately 350 monographs that are
 currently part of the Indiana Authors Project, 150 of those
 were produced through an LSTA-funded grant. The full texts
 were generated and then encoded in Extensible Markup Language
 (XML) following the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
 Guidelines, TEI Lite version P4, at a Level 3 as described in
 the Best Practices for TEI in Libraries. Starting in 2009,
 the Digital Library Program partnered with the IUB Libraries
 Technical Services Department to continue encoding additional
 texts not included in the original grant proposal. In this
 next round of encoding, full text is generated with optical
 character recognition (OCR) software that is then ported into
 automatically created TEI templates ready for additional
 markup. The TEI templates contain a pre-populated header with
 bibliographic metadata from MARC records and other
 boilerplate metadata along with automatic insertion of page
 breaks. The Technical Services team adds the additional
 structural markup to conform to Level 3 of the Best Practices
 for TEI in Libraries. Technical Services plans to complete
 encoding of the remaining monographs beyond those covered
 under the original LSTA grant.
 

 The delivery and discovery capabilities of this site are
 implemented using a customized version of the open source
 eXtensible Text Framework (XTF) developed by the California
 Digital Library. It is served using the Tomcat application
 server and Apache HTTP Server software. Local customizations
 to XTF at Indiana University include a unique native page
 image viewer and a page turner that are both driven
 exclusively by the information encoded in the source TEI
 files and require no additional software beyond what can be
 accomplished by customizing XTF's XSLT templates. This
 feature enables switching between text and page images at any
 time while navigating a document's structure, and allows
 viewing of one or more page images as moveable overlays
 simultaneously with the text in the paged text mode. The
 actual page images are stored and delivered via the IU
 Digital Library Program's Fedora repository. The encoded
 texts are stored in a local e-text repository called Xubmit,
 which was developed by the IU Digital Library Program. Xubmit
 is comprised of web services using Java and Axis, the
 Revision Control System (RCS) for file versioning, and a
 graphical user interface developed in Java that is delivered
 using the Tomcat application server. Along with the XML/TEI
 P4 files, Xubmit stores the schema and Schematron files for
 the project.
