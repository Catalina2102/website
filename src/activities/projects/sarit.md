* Host: Independent
* URL: <http://sarit.indology.info>
* Main language: Sanskrit



General description: 
 : Search and Retrieval of
 Indic Texts provides an e-text corpus of Indian literary texts mainly in Sanskrit
 and related languages, marked up according to the TEI Guidelines. Special attention
 is 
 given to the Document Header so that the etexts are traceable to specific sources
 and 
 contain revision histories. This makes them electronic editions that are usable for
 
 scholarly reference.
 



Sarit is a Sanskrit word meaning a river and is commonly used in 
 literary metaphors about short stories (rivers) combining into larger chronicles (oceans),
 
 etc. The project is building a digital library of Sanskrit and other Indian language
 
 etexts. The inspiration for the project comes directly from the Thesaurus Linguae
 Graecae 
 and the Perseus Project. provides Indologists with machine readable texts and digital
 
 instruments for philological research.



Implementation description: displays Indological texts
 marked up according to Text Encoding Initiative
 (TEI) guidelines. Its early versions used a modified version of
 [PhiloLogic](http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/philologic/), a platform 
 developed at the University of Chicago. Since 2013, has used the Open Source XML
 database 
 [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org/) for search and display, and has been developed
 by the [HRA](http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/hra-portal.html) (Jens
 Østergaard Petersen) at the [Cluster of 
 Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context"](http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/) (University of Heidelberg) in collaboration
 with [eXist Solutions GmbH](http://existsolutions.com/).
