# Kolb-Proust Archive for Research

Description:


"The was formed in January 1994 at the Library of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
 with the goal of making available to scholars world-wide the collection of letters
 and research materials assembled by Professor Philip Kolb (1907–1992) in the preparation
 of his twenty-one volume edition of the correspondence of Marcel Proust. The collection
 contains the largest number of autograph letters by Proust in the world, and many
 other supporting documents about Proust's life and times. The supporting documents
 largely consist of tens of thousands of 3 × 5 inch cards. The cards are cross-referenced
 and thus suitable for conversion to hyperlinked electronic text files. We are currently
 in the process of entering the data and tagging relevant structures and content in
 accordance with the TEI standard. We also plan to include the text of the correspondence
 and digitized images of the letters. Our goal is to preserve this information and
 make it more easily accessible and searchable, both for the local user as well as
 for the scholar consulting it through the Internet.


The Kolb-Proust Archive is a project of the University Library and the Department
 of French. It has benefited from the cooperation of the Advanced Information Technologies
 Laboratory, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the publisher
 Plon in Paris."
