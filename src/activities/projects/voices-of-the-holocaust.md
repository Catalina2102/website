General description: 
 is an online collection of
 interviews with Holocaust survivors conducted in
 the immediate aftermath of World War II. The site
 features audio, transcripts, and English
 translations of the interviews, along with a host
 of other interactive features, making it an
 invaluable historical resource for scholars and
 students of all ages. TEI encoding is used to
 provide a structured data model for the
 transcriptions, which allows various manifestations
 of the interviews (text, audio)--as well as other
 types of content (metadata, GIS, scholarly
 criticism)--to be integrated into a dynamic, robust
 presentation for the user.
