General description: This digital archive contains the
 original correspondence between the British
 Colonial Office and the colonies of Vancouver
 Island and British Columbia. This project aims to
 digitize and publish online a complete archive of
 the correspondence covering the period from 1846
 leading to the founding of Vancouver Island in
 1849, the founding of British Columbia in 1858, the
 annexation of Vancouver Island by British Columbia
 in 1866, and up to the incorporation of B.C. into
 the Canadian Federation in 1871.



Implementation description:
 This uses a standard P5 tagset. We
 are currently adding maps which will be marked up
 using the Image Markup Tool and the FACSIMILE
 module.
