General description: Thirteen active and consulting
 editors are now working together to address the urgent need
 for a comprehensive scholarly archive of Mitford’s works and
 letters. The team will prepare the first-ever openly
 accessible, chronologically organized scholarly archive of
 Mitford’s literary works and letters in digital form, with
 scholarly annotations and headnotes, extensive prosopography,
 and site-navigation tools that correlate references to
 people, places, and events across the full range of Mitford’s
 texts. In the long term, we hope to produce a comprehensive
 scholarly archive of Mitford’s complete works and over 2,000
 letters. By creating the first-ever accurate transcriptions
 of Mitford’s correspondence from her years of greatest
 productivity, the Digital Mitford Archive will freely and
 fully publish letters previously available only in manuscript
 form in obscure archives or in bowdlerized published forms. A
 chronologically structured Digital Mitford Archive will
 broadly serve educators, literary scholars, historians, and
 the reading public in illuminating transatlantic publishing
 and theater networks to this point unexplored in our literary
 history of the nineteenth century. That no such edition yet
 exists almost certainly reflects the challenging extent of a
 task that could not be completed without the assistance of a
 large and diversely specialized team of scholars. The Digital
 Mitford project is organized to bring a large group together
 and annually or semi-annually to invite and involve new
 editors and student assistants.
