# Dante's Lemmatized Works




* Host: Pisa University
* Other institutions involved: CiBit - Consorzio Interuniversitario Biblioteca Italiana Telematica (Interuniversitary
 Center for the Italian Telematic)
* URL: <http://dante.di.unipi.it/ricerca/dante.html>



Description:
 The Latin and Vernacular works of Dante have been elaborated by tracing every form
 in texts to:
 1. the relevant lemma, with additional indications; 
 2. the grammatical category to which they belong. 
 Documentation at: <http://dante.di.unipi.it/ricerca/dante.html>



Implementation description:
 The kind of language used by Dante Alighieri, both in Vernacular and in Latin, is
 of great relevance for the Italian culture. Dante's contemporaries already recognized
 the relevance of his literary work. His choice of language has deeply influenced the
 whole Italian literary tradition and the Italian language itself. To know the usus
 scribendi of Dante as much as possible, then, deepens our knowledge not only of an
 outstanding historical and critical subject, but also of the evolutionary processes
 of the Italian language itself. 
 The project is addressed to scholars as well as literary and linguistic students,
 but can freely availed by anyone with particular interest on Dante's works or language.



Other Related Resources:
 All texts are available both for reading as hypertext and linguistic querying and
 are XML-TEI encoded. The user interface for managing and querying the texts is also
 optimized for the same encoding language. The query is performed by the XCDE Search
 Engine, a tool developed at Pisa University by Prof. Paolo Ferragina. The used TEI
 tagset is a mixed base, including elements from the prose and verse base, with some
 local modifications in order to include two new elements: LM for providing the lemma
 and the grammatical information about the lemma; and OCC for providing grammatical
 and lexical information about the word.
