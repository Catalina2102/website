General description: is an open-access research database
 which provides researchers, scholars, students and
 others with the first comprehensive documentary
 history of the founding years of the Accademia di
 San Luca. Free text and guided searches by means of
 drop-down menus yield results with complete
 transcriptions of many new and previously
 unpublished documentary materials, accompanied by a
 digital image of the original document as well as a
 summary in both English and Italian. The site also
 features artist bibliographies and a growing
 database of images associated with the early
 history of the Accademia di San Luca and with its
 members during the 16th and 17th centuries.
 

 The searchable database of this Web site provides
 access to a complete transcription of every extant
 notarial record of the period from the Archivio di
 Stato di Roma identified by the project team, as
 well as a digital image of the original document.
 The transcriptions and page images are viewable
 side by side.
 

 The transcriptions are encoded in Extensible Markup
 Language (XML) following the guidelines of the
 Text-Encoding Initiative (TEI) for digital encoding
 of literary and linguistic texts
 (http://www.tei-c.org). The transcriptions may be
 searched by personal name (under all known variant
 spellings), place name, key term, document type,
 notary name, and year. The documents included are
 not only newly available to students and scholars
 of early modern Italy, but are also accessible in a
 way that both promotes their use and allows for the
 identification of additional archival
 material.



Implementation description:
 We used TEI tagsets specific to
 manuscript material, personal names, and place
 names. Our programmer implemented Perl script to
 batch process the documents from MSWord to XHTML to
 XML to HTML. We tagged the XML files in TEI
 according to the standards of the Text Encoding
 Initiative (TEI) P5 Guidelines (November
 2007).
