**General description**: Centred on *The Yellow Book* (1894-97), The Yellow Nineties Online publishes facsimile editions of a select collection of aesthetic periodicals, together with paratexts of production and reception such as cover designs, advertising materials, and reviews. This historical material is enhanced by two kinds of peer-reviewed scholarly commentary: biographies of the periodicals’ contributors and associates; and critical essays on the material by experts in the field. The project’s editorial horizon encompasses the long 1890s. The editors understand text as visual and verbal printed material, including non-referential physical elements such as bindings, page layouts, and ornaments. The intended audiences for this project include scholars, students, and others interested in the aesthetic periodicals of the 1890s. The Yellow Nineties Online is peer-reviewed and federated with the Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES).
**Implementation description**: Encoded in P5, The Yellow Nineties Online uses a customized RelaxNG schema. The project’s TEI tag set serves to record the primary and secondary texts’ typographical and material features and to track the relationships between aesthetic fin de siècle editors, publishers, authors, artists, and engravers. Users may examine and download the schema and TEI-encoded files that underpin The Yellow Nineties Online from the site. In addition to contextualizing and disseminating aesthetic periodicals, the project plays a lead role in modeling encoding workflow at Ryerson’s Centre for Digital Humanities.
