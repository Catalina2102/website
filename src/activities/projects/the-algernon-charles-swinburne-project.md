General description: The Swinburne Project is a digital
 collection and scholarly project devoted to the life
 and work of Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne.
 When complete the project will provide students and
 scholars with access to all available original works by
 Swinburne and selected contextual materials, including
 contemporary critical reactions, biographical works,
 and images of artwork about which Swinburne wrote. The
 project also serves as a platform for research into
 representation of complex documents in digital space
 and within the context of extended informational
 networks.



Implementation description:
 TEI P5. No modifications. The main texts
 use the following TEI modules: core, tei, header,
 textstructure, figures, namesdates, linking, transcr,
 msdescription, analysis, drama, verse, corpus, tagdocs,
 and nets. A glossary file for the project also uses the
 dictionaries module. And the project makes use of the
 XTM 2.0 topic map schema to maintain information about
 important topics found in Swinburne.
