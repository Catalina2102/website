Description: The economics of electronic versions of rare books was the subject of a two-year
 study being undertaken by the University of Virginia Library. Sponsored by a $400,000
 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the project compared usage and costs between
 electronic texts and original printed editions of rare early American fiction.


The project produced a large collection of digital texts: the full texts of hundreds
 of novels and short stories first edition (422 titles held in 559 volumes). includes
 books published between 1789 and 1850. The books chosen for the project range from
 the earliest American novels, such as Susanna Rowson's 


Charlotte (1791), through James Fenimore Cooper's 
 The Last of the Mohicans, Edgar Allan Poe's 
 Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque, and Nathaniel Hawthorne's 
 Scarlet Letter. All the texts were taken from rare first editions in the Barrett Collection and
 other collections in the Library's Special Collections Department.
 
 
 All texts have been TEI-encoded in SGML. As well as the transcription, every page
 is available as a colour facsimile (24-bit colour circa 400 dpi tiffs with jpeg derivatives
 on-line). Part of the collection can be freely viewed online at the above URL. The
 full collection is marketed by Chadwyck Healey (Bell & Howell).
