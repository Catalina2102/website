# The Scholarly Electronic Text and Image Service








* Host: University of Sydney Library
* URL: <http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/>



Description:


 (SETIS) at the University 
 of Sydney Library provides access to a large number of networked and 
 in-house full text databases, primarily but not exclusively, source texts 
 within the humanities. Many of these are commercially licensed texts and 
 available only to users at the University of Sydney. However, in addition 
 to these literary, philosophical and religious texts the service is engaged 
 in a number of text and image creation projects the results of which are 
 generally available freely world wide.


Through grants and sponsorships obtained from outside the library budget 
 SETIS seeks to create full text databases based upon the TEI guidelines for 
 text encoding and interchange. These projects are either initiated at 
 SETIS, usually in collaboration with other digital library initiatives, or 
 are in response to initiatives of academic staff at the 
 university. Digital library initiatives include the collection of 
 Australian Literary and Historical Texts which began in response to the 
 national Australian Cooperative Digitisation Project 1840–45 and has most 
 recently grown through SETIS' participation in the Australian Literature 
 Electronic Gateway. Other projects are: the Australian Federation Full 
 Text Database funded by the New South Wales Centenary of Federation (a 
 collection including the debates and conventions of the decade preceding 
 Australian Federation in 1901, as well as contextual writings and memoirs 
 by the participants and founders of federation). Projects in response to 
 academic research and teaching interests include: Joseph Henry Maiden's 
 


Forest Flora of New South Wales (1902–24), and other works in natural 
 history; unpublished lecture notes and other writings by Professor John 
 Anderson, an influential philosopher and social/political thinker at the 
 University of Sydney 1927–55; Mary Shelley's manuscript biography of her 
 father, William Godwin, edited by Judith Barbour in the English Department; 
 poet John Tranter's web site; selected texts from the Sydney University 
 Press backlist.
