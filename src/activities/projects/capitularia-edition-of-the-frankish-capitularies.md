# Capitularia. Edition of the Frankish Capitularies



**Host:** University of Cologne (Germany)

**URL:** <http://capitularia.uni-koeln.de/en/>

**Description:** The project is preparing a new edition of the Frankish capitularies, a pivotal corpus
 of legal sources from the European Middle Ages. Their history of transmission is rather
 unique due to the ways their dissemination took place: mostly they were transmitted
 within collections carried out by attendants of assemblies where these texts were
 promulgated, or based on copies sent to bishops and other office bearers, creating
 quite a variety of different versions of the text that once originated. Today there
 are more than 300 extant witnesses. The website presents diplomatic transcriptions
 of the various collections as well as manuscript descriptions and further resources.
 A critical edition including a commentary and translation into German will appear
 in print. The project is funded by the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences,
 Humanities and the Arts, and is being prepared in close collaboration with the Monumenta
 Germaniae Historica (MGH) and the Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH).
