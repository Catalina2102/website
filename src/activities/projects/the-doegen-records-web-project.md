General description: This digital archive of Irish
 dialect recordings made during 1928-31 comprises an

 recordings of folktales, songs and other material.
 It includes recordings from many regions of Ireland
 where traditional Irish dialects have disappeared
 since the time the recordings were made.

 speakers will also be added (likely in TEI).
