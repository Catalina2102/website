title: "Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies"

* Host: Yale University Library
* URL: <http://www.library.yale.edu/testimonies/>



Description:
 The (VAHT) currently 
 
 holds over 4,300 videotaped testimonies of Holocaust survivors and 
 
 witnesses that constitute over 10,000 recorded hours of videotape. The 
 
 Archive creates time-coded finding aids for all cataloged testimonies, 
 
 which enable patrons to locate specific segments of interest within a 
 
 given testimony. Finding aids are made available only at the Archive.
 
 
 
 The three main goals of the program are to (1) standardize the Video 
 
 Archive's finding aids, (2) implement a file format that can be easily 
 
 manipulated and will remain available over time, (3) develop new means of 
 
 access to our materials through a search engine and the integration of 
 
 digital video files. A prototype database has been developed to allow TEI 
 
 searching, but the result is redirected to the publicly available MARC 
 
 record.
 
 
 
 As of September 2004, two hundred files have been encoded using TEI, with 
 
 new files being added.



Implementation description:
 The Archive has begun retroactively encoding these finding aids using the 
 
 Text Encoding for Interchange (TEI), including additional information 
 
 provided by the Archive staff. The Archive has implemented an Open Office 
 
 template that will ensure that future finding aids remain consistent and 
 
 can be easily manipulated to create on-the-fly TEI-compliant XML files, 
 
 which can be used to output documents in a variety of formats. Structured 
 
 catalog information is added to the TEI files by merging with MARC data 
 
 derived from the university's online catalog, ORBIS.
