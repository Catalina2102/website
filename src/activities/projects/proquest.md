Description:


Bell & Howell took over Chadwyck-Healey in 1999, and is now known as Information
 and Learning. Chadwyck-Healey created large databases of literary and linguistic resources,
 in English and other languages, and these are now available through Bell & Howell.
 One of the largest resources is Literature Online (<http://lion.chadwyck.co.uk/>), which contains digital versions of over 260,000 literary texts, composed from the
 7th century CE up to the 20th century. However, Chadwyck-Healey produced many other
 full-text databases, including material in a range of European languages, and reference
 works. The digital versions include the full text, annotations by the author, critical
 apparatus, and any images and illustrations of the print version being digitized.
 These have been encoded in SGML, closely following the TEI scheme. The databases are
 available on CD-ROM (enabling one to build customized searching, making full use of
 the SGML encoding), and online, in HTML.


The full-text databases are available by subscription from the address below. Prices
 are aimed at institutions rather than individuals.
