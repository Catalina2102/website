# British Women Romantic Poets, 1789–1832



 
 


* **Host:** Humanities/Social Sciences Department, Shields Library, University of California–Davis
* **URL:** <http://digital.lib.ucdavis.edu/projects/bwrp/>


**Description:** The goal of this project is the design and development of highly accurate and reliable
 electronic editions of works published by British women poets between 1789 and 1832.
 The texts will be tagged using Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and encoded
 using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, with the TEI Lite DTD.
 
 Texts are being selected in consultation with an Editorial Advisory Board consisting
 of scholars in the United States and Canada. Our aim is to make complete texts available
 that are not readily accessible from other sources.
 
 In the initial stages of the project, texts will be drawn from the UC–Davis Shields
 Library's Kohler Collection of British Poetry, housed in the Department of Special
 Collections.
 
 For the TEI local usage manual used by the project, see <http://digital.lib.ucdavis.edu/projects/bwrp/BWRPveg.htm>.
 
 **Funding:** A Librarians Association of the University of California Research grant has allowed
 us to purchase two copies of Author/Editor software and to hire student taggers. Other
 staffing is provided by volunteer interns. Generous technical consultation with the
 University Office of Instructional Technology and the Shields library is allowing
 us to proceed with the tagging of texts.
