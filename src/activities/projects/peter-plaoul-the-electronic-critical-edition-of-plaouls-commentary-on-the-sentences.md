# Peter Plaoul: The Electronic Critical Edition of Plaoul's Commentary on the Sentences




* Host: Jeffrey Witt
* URL: <http://petrusplaoul.org>
* Main language: Latin



General description: While the site is not yet complete,
 I wanted to create a site, which would use the
 advantages of the web to create a more transparent
 critical edition.
 

 Most notably this means, my site tries to give you
 continued access to the manuscript, even after the
 transcription is complete. But it also comes with a
 critical apparatus, which can be accessed "inline"
 or at the the end of text. The site allows provides
 a comment feature so that users can interact with
 the text and suggests better readings or alert the
 editor to errors. Eventually, I would like to add
 to this: individual transcriptions of each
 manuscript and an English translation.
 

 The intended audience is philosophers, theologians,
 and historians, who specialize in late medieval
 thought.
 

 The entire project is coded in TEI -- using the
 critical apparatus schema of TEI5 -- the html is
 prepared through XSLT, and the final result is
 displayed dynamically with PHP.
