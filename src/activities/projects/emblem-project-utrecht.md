General description: The site contains 27 books of love emblems, originating from the Netherlands and
 Flanders. The emblem was an art form which was hugely popular in the 16th and 17th
 centuries. An emblem typically consists of a picture, a brief and often mystifying
 motto or lemma, and an epigram which links lemma and picture. Dutch emblem writers
 of the period focused their attention on the subject of love (both secular and religious).
 Their books were very much addressed to an international audience, often containing
 texts in several languages (Latin, French, English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian).
 
The books were transcribed in TEI P4. The TEI source is available. All emblems have
 been indexed using Iconclass. Most of the Latin texts have been provided with translations.
 Emblems that use similar textual or pictorial motifs have been cross-linked.
