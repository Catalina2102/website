General description: This archive constitutes a resource
 for studying the literary history of popular British and
 American poetry. Much of it composed during what can be
 called the “bull market” of poetry's popularity(1), late
 eighteenth- and nineteenth-century popular poetry was often
 written in what came to be designated an "effeminate" style,
 whether written by men or women. Writings in the poetess
 tradition were disseminated in myriad collections:
 miscellanies, beauties, literary annuals, gift books. They
 achieved a place of prominence in virtually every
 middle-class household. The Database now
 contains a bibliography of over 4,000 entries for works by
 and about writers working in and against the “poetess
 tradition,” the extraordinarily popular, but much criticized,
 flowery poetry written in Britain and America between 1750
 and 1900.



Implementation description:
 Majority of texts encoded in TEI P4,
 but all new texts being added in P5. TEI code available for
 every text.
