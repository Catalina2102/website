General description: The , funded by the DFG, is a Virtual
 research environment concerned with the works of the
 Andalusian Philosopher Averroes. DARE aims to provide
 scholars with the digitized manuscripts and incunables of
 Averroes's works, as well as edited full texts, in all
 three language traditions of Averroes's works - Arabic,
 Hebrew and Latin.
 





Implementation description:
 TEI forms the backbone of DARE's
 data. The structure of the texts, the manuscript
 descriptions, the bibliography and the chunks of the full
 texts are all encoded in TEI. DARE itself runs in a
 Drupal-CMS, and the XML server is Xeletor
 (http://developer.berlios.de/projects/xeletor), a highly
 scalable and performance oriented XML server, whose
 developement was also in part funded by DARE. As all
 software developed in the course of the project, Xeletor is
 licensed under the LGPL
 (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).
