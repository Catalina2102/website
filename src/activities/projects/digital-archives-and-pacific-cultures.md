General description: Faculty and students at the
 University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg are working on a
 long-range digital project to code and analyze the voyage
 narratives of eighteenth-century European expeditions to the
 Pacific, together with the English poetry and print media
 that responded to the published accounts of Pacific voyages.
 We are attempting to study the cross-cultural significance of
 European voyages in the Pacific and cultural contact
 experiences in Oceania and Australia, using digital coding
 and “text-mining”—to collect information from very long
 voyage records in systematic ways through computational
 methods.
 

 One phase of our work involves preparing digital editions of
 Pacific voyage publications by Hawkesworth, Cook, and the
 Forsters in TEI. Some of the voyage accounts we have prepared
 for the site have not been freely available online in any
 searchable form before. Some are available in proprietary or
 public databases, but have not to this point been united in
 one place. In addition to preparing editions, we have
 collected the geographic coordinates recorded in these
 publications using regular expression matching and
 autotagging, in order to generate Google Earth & Map
 views of the voyages. Our Google Earth projections of
 Wallis's and Cook's voyages offer a clickable interface, so
 that selecting a compass rose point along the voyage brings
 up a paragraph or block of text from a voyage record
 describing events recorded in connection with this place.
 Please see, for example:

 We have also been preparing TEI editions of poems, plays, and
 excerpts from literary and philosophical texts that respond
 in some way to the Pacific voyage publications:

 These texts were located by searching the ECCO and ECCO TCP
 databases, and we will be adding more material from these
 resources and the Burney collection. Our students have been
 preparing and marking these files to code specific kinds of
 cultural interactions so that we can study how English texts
 represented Pacific encounters, and identify the types of
 interactions which seem to have caught the interest of
 Atlantic-bound media. We've also provided an interactive
 clickable interface to "color-code" the poems, highlighting
 names of people and places as well as the cultural markup our
 students have applied: See our edition of Anna Seward's
 "Elegy on Captain Cook" (1780):
 http://pacific.pitt.edu/CookElegy1780.html
 

 Please see, also, our edition of Gerald Fitzgerald's "The
 Injured Islanders," (1779) produced just before the news of
 Cook's death became known in England. We offer Fitzgerald's
 poem as a significant contrast to the cultural
 representations in Seward's work:

 The project began and is developing at the University of
 Pittsburgh’s Greensburg campus, but the site’s initial
 development joined a team of faculty and undergraduate
 students at the Pittsburgh and Greensburg campuses. As the
 project continues to develop, it combines classroom teaching
 of digital humanities research methods together with new
 research to build a publicly accessible resource. Our texts
 and markup, and our data visualization experiments are very
 much a work in progress, and are freely available to the
 public for reading or to download as the basis of new digital
 projects under a Creative Commons license. Our site will
 continue to expand over the next few years as we experiment
 with topic modelling the Pacific voyage texts and as we
 develop new maps, search tools, and network graphics, working
 with new groups of students.
