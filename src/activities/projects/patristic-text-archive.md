# Patristic Text Archive
**Host:** Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Germany


**URL:** <https://patristictextarchive.github.io>


**Description:**


The “Patristic Text Archive” provides everyone interested with a collection of Late Antique Christian texts (i.e. “Patristic” is conceived in a very broad sense). The archive starts off with Greek texts, but it is open to all languages, in which texts from Late Antique Christianity are transmitted. The archive is furthermore a place for translations of Patristic texts in all modern languages.


All texts are licensed by a Creative Commons Licence for use and re-use. All texts are encoded as XML files and according to the Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (in version P5) of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) following an own schema (built upon the EpiDoc-Guidelines). To ensure further interoperability all files follow the CapiTainS Guidelines.


As far as possible the texts are based on critical editions and are provided together with the textcritical information, but if that is not possible, older and/or non-critical editions are also provided.


The editions in the archive can be enriched with further annotations (besides the textcritical annotations), for example encoding of biblical quotes, of places (with links to the Pleiades Gazetteer), or of persons (with links to the Gemeinsame Normdatei [GND]).
