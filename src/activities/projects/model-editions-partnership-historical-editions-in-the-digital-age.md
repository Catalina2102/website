# Model Editions Partnership: Historical Editions in the Digital Age








* Host: University of South Carolina, History Department
* URL: http://mep.cla.sc.edu/ (obsolete) archived at <http://wyatt.elasticbeanstalk.com/mep/>



Description:


The Model Editions Partnership is a consortium of seven historical editions which
 has joined forces with leaders of the Text Encoding Initiative and the Center for
 Electronic Text in the Humanities. The participants have developed a "prospectus"
 setting forth editorial guidelines for publishing historical documents in electronic
 form. There are also seven miniature editions for those studying American history.
 


Goals of the partnership include:


* To develop new approaches for addressing questions of intellectual access and context.
* To develop a generalized model for the process of preparing and delivering electronic
 editions.
* To create a series of sample editions which validate the first two goals.
* To provide clear documentation of the process for creating those sample editions.
