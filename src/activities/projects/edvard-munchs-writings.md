General description: The Munch Museum’s project related to producing a historical and critical primary
 source collection of Edvard Munch’s writings was set up in August 2007. The initial
 phase, A Digital Archive, was launched on 20 January 2011. The second phase, in English
 (2011–2012), involved establishing authorised English translations of a selection
 of Munch's writings equipped with commentaries and accompanied by supplementary articles
 and facsimiles of the originals. The aim of the third phase, Correspondence to Munch
 (2012–2015), is to publish online the 6000 letters to Munch in the museum's collection.
 The transcriptions of these will be equipped with commentaries and accompanied by
 facsimiles of the originals and they will be linked to the texts, persons and institutions
 already in the digital archive.
 
The publication is easily accessible for young students and other interested parties
 as well as satisfying the demands of scholars for accuracy. The digital archive contains
 digital facsimiles and encoded transcriptions of the original manuscripts. The transcriptions
 are reproduced diplomatically.
