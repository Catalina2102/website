title: "LdoD Archive: Collaborative Digital Archive of the Book of Disquiet"
---



**Host:** University of Coimbra

**Description:**
The LdoD Archive is a collaborative digital archive of the Book of Disquiet by Fernando
 Pessoa. It contains images of the autograph documents, new transcriptions of those
 documents and also transcriptions of four editions of the work. In addition to reading
 and comparing transcriptions, the LdoD Archive enables users to collaborate in creating
 virtual editions of the Book of Disquiet. It also includes a writing module which,
 in the future, will allow users to write variations based on fragments from the Book.
 Thus the LdoD Archive combines a representational principle with a simulation principle:
 the first is expressed through the representation of the history and processes of
 writing and editing the Book; the second is embodied in the fact that users are given
 the possibility of playing various roles in the literary process (reading, editing,
 writing), using the flexibility of the digital medium for experimenting with the Book
 of Disquiet as a literary machine. The project started in 2012 and its first release
 was published in December 2017.
