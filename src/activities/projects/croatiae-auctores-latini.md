# Croatiae auctores Latini




* Host: Faculty of Humanities and Social
 Sciences, University of Zagreb
* URL: <http://www.ffzg.hr/klafil/croala>
* Main language: Latin



General description: The (CroALa)
 digital collection aims to establish an accessible
 frame for collecting and publishing Croatian neo-Latin
 texts written from ca. 1100 to the present day.
 Intended audience are primarily scholars and students
 from different fields (neo-Latin literature and
 philology, Croatian and Early Modern European history,
 history of science, art history, theology) dealing with
 neo-Latin texts either as sources or as research
 objects.



Implementation description:
 The CroALa texts encoded in TEI XML are
 published through PhiloLogic full-text search,
 retrieval and analysis system. Therefore CroALa uses a
 relatively small selection of TEI tagsets and elements
 adapted primarily to the search capabilities offered by
 PhiloLogic. At the moment priority is to support
 searching by genres, authors, and dates.
