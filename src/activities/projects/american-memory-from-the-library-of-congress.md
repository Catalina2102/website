# American Memory from the Library of Congress



 
 


* **Host:** [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/)

**Description:** "American Memory consists of primary source and archival materials relating to American
 culture and history. These historical collections are the key contribution of the
 Library of Congress to the National Digital Library. Most of these offerings are from
 the Library's unparalleled special collections.
 
 "The Library is converting a wide array of documents to searchable form, including
 books, pamphlets, legal materials, serial articles, and manuscripts. The American
 Memory Document Type Definition (AMMEM.DTD) was developed to accommodate this broad
 range of materials by conceptualizing a generalized humanities text, rather than seeking
 to describe specific document types and subtypes, or text genres. Simple, streamlined
 models and flexible structure are characteristic of AMMEM.DTD.
 
 The American Memory DTD is based on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), which has
 established a set of models and guidelines for encoding texts in the humanities."

 itself, see the [American Memory DTD for Historical Documents](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/amdtd.html).
