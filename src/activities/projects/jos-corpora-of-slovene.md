* Host: Jožef Stefan Institute
* Other institutions involved:
 Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana
* URL: <http://nl.ijs.si/jos/index-en.html>
* Main language: Slovene



General description: The JOS project developed Slovene annotated
 corpora and associated resources meant to facilitate
 development of Human Language Technologies for the Slovene
 language. The main results are the JOS morphosyntactic
 specifications (tagset definition), two annotated corpora,
 and two Web services. The developed resources are available
 under the Creative Commons licences.



Implementation description:
 The corpora and morphosyntactic specifications
 are encoded in TEI P5 using the additional modules for
 
 corpora, linking, analysis and iso-fs plus a few local
 extensions.



Related resources: Links to papers describing the corpora are
