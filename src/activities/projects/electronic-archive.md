Description:


The long-range goal of the 


Piers Plowman is the creation of a multi-level, hyper-textually linked electronic archive of the
 textual tradition of all three versions of the fourteenth-century allegorical dream
 vision 
 Piers Plowman. Project editors Robert Adams, Eric Eliason, Ralph Hanna, III, Thorlac Turville-Petre,
 and I will begin by making documentary editions of B manuscripts CFGHmLMRW in the
 first years, by preparing color digital facsimiles of those manuscripts, by reconstructing
 the B archetype (the latest common copy from which all extant witnesses can be shown
 to descend), and by establishing a critical edition of the B version with appropriate
 textual, linguistic, and codicological annotation for each of the three levels of
 the Archive. We will continue preparing documentary editions of the remaining B manuscripts
 and early printed texts and begin transcribing A and C manuscripts.
 
 
 William Langland wrote three distinct versions (A, B, and C) of 


Piers Plowman. Scribes and early editors produced several more combined versions of A and C. Of
 the fifty-four more or less complete surviving manuscripts of the poem, seventeen
 are of the B version, which is now the most widely read, and also the version with
 the most complex textual history. All the surviving witnesses are full of errors,
 some the result of incompetence, others the product of sophisticated re-writing.
 
 
 An electronic edition does not suppress editorial disagreement or impose spurious
 notions of authority, as printed editions often tend to do. Instead, it embraces the
 provisional nature of scholarly editing. We shall make permanently available the texts
 on which future editorial and literary study must be based, and we shall propose a
 set of solutions to editorial problems without suggesting that they will have final
 authority. Future scholars will be able to incorporate their own insights into the
 Archive. By tackling what is textually the most difficult work in Middle English,
 we hope to develop a model for computer-generated editions that will have value beyond
 the confines of Middle English literary studies.
