Description:


The (OTA) was established in 1976 to
 collect, catalogue, preserve, and distribute the electronic
 products of research and scholarship in all areas of textual,
 literary, and linguistic studies. The OTA holds an extensive
 collection of electronic texts and linguistic corpora in a
 variety of languages which are of interest to academics
 working in the humanities. These resources are free of charge
 and can be downloaded or ordered via our web site listed
 above.


The OTA is funded via the Arts and Humanities Data Service
 (AHDS), who, through its constituent members, seek to support
 and advise the humanities community within the UK.


The OTA is continually on the look-out for scholarly
 digital resources which might be of interest to the literary
 and linguistic communities, especially those in the UK. If
 you have created such a resource please contact us for
 information on how the OTA can help with its preservation,
 and if desired, redistribution.
