General description: Our project sets out to digitize
 Dingler’s 
 Polytechnisches Journal 
 (Polytechnical Journal), which was published over a
 period of 111 
 years between 1820 and 1931. The journal is unique and
 highly 
 relevant for very different research fields
 which focus on the cultural 
 history as it emerged from Europe’s technical
 transformations. 
 Therefore it is significant not only for
 people engaged in the history 
 of science, but for anyone interested in the cultural
 heritage of 
 Europe.


Aside from the digitization of the journal’s images, we
 encode the 
 OCRed text according to the TEI-P5 Guidelines. At the
 moment (May 
 2011) 219 fully encoded books (i.e. around 220 million
 characters) are 
 available. Additionally we provide access to more than
 50000 figures 
 on 1633 plates encoded using the UVic image markup
 tool. Furthermore 
 our indexes cover more than 13000 person entries and
 450 different 
 (mostly European) journals, in which the articles
 originally had been 
 published.



Implementation description:
 In addition to the four basic TEI-P5
 modules we make use of following modules:
 
 figures, transcr, tagdocs, gaiji, linking, namesdates.
 The list of
 
 attributes was restricted to specific given values for
 following
 
 elements: ab, bibl, div, figure, milestone, persName,
 pb, text, titlePart and titlePage.
