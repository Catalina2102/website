General description: The Bloomington Faculty Council (BFC) is
 a representative body of elected members from the
 Bloomington campus of Indiana University. During the
 early 1970s, Indiana University experienced a
 reorganization of the system administration which
 created a University Faculty Council responsible for
 faculty governance of the eight IU campuses and a
 Bloomington Faculty Council responsible for faculty
 governance on the Bloomington campus. With the adoption
 of the Constitution of the Bloomington Faculty of
 Indiana University on May 6, 1975, the authority of
 faculty members on the Bloomington campus was
 solidified.
 

 The digitized BFC collection features two key
 documents: BFC minutes and circulars. The BFC minutes
 are verbatim transcriptions of the monthly BFC meetings
 from each academic year. The circulars are
 supplementary documents that often serve as the basis
 of discussions at BFC meetings and range in scope from
 Memorial Resolutions to policy changes in the Academic
 Calendar or Faculty Handbook.



Implementation description:
 To facilitate searching and the proper
 display of these administrative documents, the Indiana
 University Bloomington Faculty Council minutes and
 circulars are encoded following the Text Encoding
 Initiative (TEI) Guidelines (version P4) with a focus
 on the document structure (tables, lists, etc.) and
 editorial conventions (strikethroughs, deletions,
 etc.). Minutes and circulars are comprised of both
 born-digital and print documents. Typewritten documents
 were scanned using FineReader Optical Character
 Recognition (OCR) software to generate full-text for
 TEI encoding. The born-digital documents, namely the
 circulars, often undergo a series of revisions (i.e.,
 Microsoft Word's "Track Changes"), which require the
 encoding to reflect in-line comments, additions,
 deletions and strikethroughs, all common editorial
 conventions. As encoding progresses, this site will be
 updated with a goal to eventually include all existing
 sets of minutes and circulars from 1969 to the
 present.
