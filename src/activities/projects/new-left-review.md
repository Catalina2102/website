# New Left Review








* URL: <http://www.newleftreview.org>



Description:



Established for forty years as a key journal of the international Left, NLR has been
 transformed since 2000 into a new resource for the new century. Its range covers world
 politics and the global economy; state powers and protest movements; contemporary
 social theory; history and philosophy; cinema and literature; heterodox art and aesthetics....



Print subscribers to the journal gain access to its online archive. The website is
 run from TEI-compliant XML documents, of all NLR issues since January 2000.



Technical background:




We decided on TEI after trawling
 the Internet for some real and workable solution to the problem of
 publishing on-line editions of the journal. We produce the initial XML files for each article from
 a plug-in to 
 InDesign that Jacob applies once he has
 done the type setting for the printed issue. This is then processed by
 a succession of XSLT stylesheets with some manual intervention, which
 ultimately produces the HTML web pages. In fact the last
 transformation generates an ASP file as this gives us the ability to
 easily protect the pages so they can only be read by subscribers.
 Originally we wanted to generate pages 
 on-the-fly
 but as we rent our server space this proved impractical in the short
 term. This, however, is the ultimate goal. There are also plans to
 reuse the composite XML files for libraries, eg. on CD-ROM. (Glenn
