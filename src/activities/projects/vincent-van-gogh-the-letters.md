General description: The Van Gogh Letters project published all of the extant correspondence from or
 to the painter Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). The 903 letters and 25 related manuscripts
 were published both online and in a six-volume printed edition. The online edition
 gives a new transcription in the original languages (Dutch and French), a new translation
 into English, extensive annotation, and illustrations for all of the works of art
 mentioned in the correspondence. All references to persons and works of art have been
 indexed. An extensive introduction provides background to the correspondence and explains
 the editorial procedures. Additional material includes a glossary, a chronology of
 Van Gogh's life, linked to the letters, a concordance to earlier editions of the letters
 and a bibliography. 
 
For each letter, an XML file contains the metadata, the original text, the translated
 text and the annotation. The introductory material was also encoded in TEI.
