Description:
 The aim of the Scholarly Digital Editions of Slovenian
 Literature project is to compile a collection of digital critical editions of Slovenian
 literary texts and sources for literary studies. The majority of editions include
 digital facsimiles, diplomatic transcription and critical transcription. Currently,
 two pilot editions are available on-line, several others being prepared. 



Implementation description:
 The digital editions use TEI P4 (XML) for their encoding model, with the following
 tagsets: prose, figures, linking, and transcription. We also employ local modifications,
 which add 
 page and 
 line container elements, fix the values of rend and place attributes and make some other
 slight modifications. The editions themselves are each encoded as one 
 TEI.2 document, with nested <div>isions explicating their internal structure, be it separate
 poems, sermons, letters, or their different transcriptions. Facsimile files are stored
 externally, with the 
 figure elements providing the linkage.
