Description:


A pioneering distribution point for TEI-conformant
 Electronic Texts, and indeed for the first online version of the TEI
 Guidelines itself (see <http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/tei/uvatei.html>) and home of
 several major scholarly projects (listed separately on the main TEI
 Applications page) at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
 Humanities.


Since August 2000, the Center has been issuing many of its texts as
 ebooks for MS Reader and Palm. There are now over 1,600 freely-available
 ebooks: you can see them at <http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/ebooks/ebooklist.html>.
