# Brown University Women Writers Project



 
 


* **Host:** Brown University
* **URL:** <http://www.wwp.brown.edu/>


**Description:** "The Women Writers Project textbase is a collection of over 200 English texts by
 women from the period 1450-1850. The collection is designed to support a wide range
 of activities, including new research on texts and cultural history, and innovative
 approaches to teaching. It enables scholars to recover and disseminate the range of
 writings in English by women and it creates opportunities for
 undergraduate and graduate students to learn - through textbase development, modern
 textual editing and collaborative research."
 
 **Funders:** "The Women Writers Project is primarily supported by the National Endowment for the
 Humanities, the Mellon Foundation, and Brown University. (See the [Brown WWP Newsletter (Spring, 1996), "From the Director"](http://www.wwp.brown.edu/project/newsletter/vol02num03/fromdir023.html) for a more detailed discussion of present and future funding of the project.)
 
 The WWP is a non-profit enterprise, headquartered at Brown University."
