Description:
 The Wright American Fiction online collection attempts to include every novel published
 in the United States from 1851 to 1875. This is a collection of 19th century American
 fiction, as listed in Lyle Wright's bibliography American Fiction, 1851-1875. There
 are currently 2,887 volumes included (2,463 unedited, 424 fully edited and encoded)
 by 1,387 authors. These texts are available for searching and browsing, using the
 digital page images. The text files have not been proofread or corrected, and still
 contain errors. We are working through this group, correcting errors and adding SGML
 encoding. This group of fully edited texts allows you to view both the electronic
 text as well as the page images.



Implementation description:
 TEILite DTD v1.6, with modifications to the PB element. REF, SEQ, RES, FTM and PAGES
 attributes have been added to PB. Open and close tags are required for all elements.
