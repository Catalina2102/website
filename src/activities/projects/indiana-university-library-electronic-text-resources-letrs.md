Description:


"The Library Electronic Text Resource Service (LETRS) is the center for electronic
 texts in the humanities at Indiana University. The LETRS service began in 1992, and
 the facility, located in the Main Library on the Bloomington campus, was finished
 in early 1994 and officially opened in September 1994. LETRS is jointly supported
 by the library and University Computing Services, and provides access to a large collection
 of linguistic and literary texts over a local area network available in the facility,
 in languages ranging from classical Greek, Latin, Arabic and Hebrew to modern German,
 French, and English. LETRS also provides access to a growing collection of electronic
 resources over the campus network, including the Oxford English Dictionary, the Chadwyck-Healey
 English Poetry Full-Text Database and Database of African-American Poetry, and the
 Complete Novels of Jane Austen. LETRS also supports the creation of electronic texts
 in the humanities, such as [The Victorian Women Writers Project](http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/vwwp/index.html) and provides training and support in the use of the TEI Guidelines for electronic
 text projects. The LETRS staff may be contacted directly at [LETRS@indiana.edu](mailto:letrs@indiana.edu)."
