# Project Lorelei








* URL: <http://www2.hu-berlin.de/literatur/projekte/loreley/>



Description:


The project combines
 texts, annotations, and commentary relating to the legend of
 the Lorelei.


The section labelled 


TEI-Lite Vernetzung und
 Verfuhrungsszenarien contains a brief introduction to
 SGML and the Text Encoding Initiative, and an explanation of
 the Project's decision to encode texts in SGML and its choice
 of the TEI Lite DTD. This is followed by chapters describing
 the basics of SGML syntax, text analysis and encoding
 illustrated by examples of TEI-conformant markup used by the
 project, as well as chapters on the TEI header and linking
 mechanism. Two sections are devoted to the Project's decision
 to investigate and make searchable narrative motives and
 imagery in texts by encoding individual words and passages
 using an element SEG with its attributes. The document ends
 with an annotated list of all elements and attributes used by
 the project
