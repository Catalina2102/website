Description:
The CURSUS project, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB),
aims to produce online editions of the major surviving
sources of the medieval English Benedictine Office liturgy
prior to the Reformation. The project ran from May
2000 with AHRB funding until September 2003. The editions
of the sources, which comprise both manuscripts and early
printed books, will be encoded to highlight the different
types of liturgical text whether breviary, missal, hymnal,
antiphoner, or portiforium, and then the different genre
of text within each (e.g. chants, prayers, biblical and
hagiographical readings, homilies). The electronic texts
were encoded with a TEI P4 extended variant. The Web site includes
information about the project (sources and methodology), editions of the manuscripts, a version of the vulgate used for lectio, and centralised repository of all antiphons/responds/prayers containing the Corpus Antiphonalium Officii.
