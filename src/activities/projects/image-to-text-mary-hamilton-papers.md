title: "Image to Text: Mary Hamilton papers"

**Host:** University of Manchester
**URL:** <http://www.projects.alc.manchester.ac.uk/image-to-text/>
**Description:** 
This project currently presents letters from the Mary Hamilton Papers in the University
 of Manchester Libraryâ€™s Special Collections. So far over 400 of nearly 3000 documents
 have been published online. The archive is a rich, underexplored resource for literary,
 linguistic and art history and political, social and royal history in the latter half
 of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. A grant has been applied for by
 a multi-disciiplinary team to permit a number of interconnected research strands to
 be conducted on a complete online edition of all the papers.
