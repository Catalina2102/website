Description:
 The Real Biblioteca (Royal Library), with different names as Real Particular or Private
 Library, has been the private library of the Kings and Queens of the House of Bourbon
 since the arrival of Felipe V (1724-1746).
 With Carlos IV (1788-1808) the Real Biblioteca knew a period of great splendour, mainly
 because some outstanding and valuable collections became part of its holdings. Among
 them, we can mention the magnificent library gathered by don Diego Sarmiento de Acuña,
 count of Gondomar and ambassador of Felipe III in London at the beginning of the xviith
 Century.
 The Royal Library holds the papers and the books of the Count of Gondomar's Library,
 one of the most important spanish libraries of the XVIIth century.
 This project provides the transcription of the Inventories and the current identification
 and normalized description of the books. We add the edition of Letters with a special
 relevance to study these collections.
 Extensible Text Framework (XTF) is the publishing system we have chosen.
