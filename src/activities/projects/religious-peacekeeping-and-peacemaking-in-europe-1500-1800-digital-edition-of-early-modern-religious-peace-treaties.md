title: "Religious Peacekeeping and Peacemaking in Europe, 1500-1800: Digital Edition of Early Modern Religious Peace Treaties"
---



**Host:** University and State Library Darmstadt
**URL:** <http://www.religionsfrieden.de>
**Description:**
The goal of the digital edition of several European peace treaties from the period
 between 1500 and 1800 is to be a text basis for comparative research on Early Modern
 religious peace-making in Europe. As the basis of the edition serve the texts of the
 religious peace treaties as they were first published and read (editio princeps).
 Each text has a detailed introduction and comprehensive commentary, and contains original
 as well as normalized readings with the original facsimile incorporated. Both text
 basis and introduction are encoded in TEI including encoding of places and persons
 mentioned in the text. The digital edition will be published in the newly established
 Darmstadt Center for Digital Editions.
