# Bodleian Library: Toyota City Imaging Project



 
 


* **Host:** Bodleian Library, University of Oxford
* **URL:** <http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/toyota>


**Description:** This project includes images of "motor car ephemera" from the John Johnson Collection,
 the "most important collection of printed ephemera in the United Kingdom and possibly
 in the world." These images are "supplemented by 1,000 images of other forms of transport."
 
 Funded and staffed in part by Toyota City, the "images were produced by means of Kodak's
 Photo-CD technology: the original items were photographed onto 35mm slides, and scanned
 onto Photo-CD discs. These were then processed to convert the images to compressed
 JPEG and GIF images at the various resolutions used in the system.
 
 The bibliographic information for each item is held in SGML (Standard Generalised
 Markup Language) format, conforming to the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) scheme.
 The SGML records are processed by a TCL script and converted to HTML (Hypertext Markup
 Language) for display on the World Wide Web."
