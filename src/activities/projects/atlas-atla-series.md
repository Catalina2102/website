# ATLAS : ATLA Series



 
 


* **Host:** American Theological Library Association
* **URL:** <http://www.atla.com/products/catalogs.html>


**Description:** ATLAS is an online collection of major religion and theology journals selected by
 leading religion scholars and theologians. Users can read articles or research the
 history of a topic from 1949 to the present. Currently, researchers are able to use
 the ATLA Religion Database as a search tool to retrieve images of the pages in more
 than fifty different journals. In the second phase, page images will be supplemented
 with fully searchable texts of the articles (XML). Furthermore, during the second
 phase, images and indexing coverage will be extended back to the original publication
 date of each journal.
 
 **Implementation description:** TEI Lite.
 
 **Access:** Access via annual subscription.
