# Women's Travel Writing, 1830–1930








* Host: University of Minnesota Libraries Electronic Text Research Center (ETRC)

Description:


Working with faculty and students in various
 university departments including English, French & Italian, History,
 Anthropology & Women's Studies, the ETRC is digitizing texts and related
 materials concerning women travel writers in the period 1830–1930. We
 emphasize American women travellers, but include selected European women
 travellers from the same period. A distinctive feature of our project is
 the application of additional analytical encoding (using four major
 groups of topics important to the study of the corpus). This enables
 retrieval & analysis beyond what is possible with full-text searching.
