Description:


FIDA, the Corpus of Slovene Language, represents a reference corpus of the Slovene
 language and was compiled within the framework of a joint project involving four
 partners; two from the academic/research sphere and two commercial ones: the Faculty
 of Arts (University of Ljubljana), the Jožef Stefan Institute, the DZS, General
 Publishing and the Amebis software company. Corpus compilation started in spring 1997
 and was concluded by the end of 2000. The project was funded by the two commercial
 partners.


The corpus contains just over 100 million words of
 contemporary Slovene texts, encompassing a broad range of Slovene language variants
 and
 registers as found in the Slovene press, complemented by some texts from the Internet
 and speech transcripts.


The corpus represents contemporary Slovene from the second half of
 the 20th century, with the majority of texts having been produced in the 90s.
 It is composed of written texts and
 texts originally produced as written for speaking purposes; speech transcripts – 
 parliamentary proceedings – are the only spoken component of the corpus.


The corpus is not freely available and can be
 accessed only with a valid username and password.
