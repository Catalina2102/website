# Inscriptions of Greek Cyrenaica




**Host:** University of Bologna
 
 **URL:** <https://igcyr.unibo.it>
**Description:** The IGCyr corpus assembles 920 inscriptions from Greek Cyrenaica (VII-I centuries
 B.C.). The majority of these inscriptions have been published previously, while 125
 of them are unpublished. The GVCyr corpus assembles about 56 Greek metrical inscriptions
 from Greek and Roman Cyrenaica; 48 out of them have been published already, but they
 have never been studied together.
 
 The Inscriptions of Greek Cyrenaica project has published these materials in two online
 EpiDoc corpora : IGCyr and GVCyr, which can be consulted separately, or cross-searched.
 Each inscription record presents metadata description, bibliography, Greek text, apparatus,
 translation into modern languages (English, French, Italian and Arabic), and commentary,
 together with the fullest available collection of illustrations. The new corpora are
 presented as two series of documents; but they also include geographical information
 linking to various projects gathered on the website Heritage Gazetteer of Libya (<http://www.slsgazetteer.org>) developed by the Society for Libyan Studies in London.
