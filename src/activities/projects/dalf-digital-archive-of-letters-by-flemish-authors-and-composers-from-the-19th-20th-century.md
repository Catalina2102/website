Description:
 The availability of correspondences of authors and composers with their family, friends
 and colleagues, musicians, critics, illustrators, publishers, etc. is of great importance
 to literary scholars as well as to (art) historians, linguists, cultural sociologists
 etc. Letters do give an insight in and provide valuable information about, for instance
 the writing or composing process of an author or a composer, the dating, meaning and
 reception of a work, and provide further biographical details.
 
 
 
 In view of its assignment to study and valorize the Flemish literary heritage, the
 Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document Studies of the Royal Academy of Dutch Language
 and Literature (Centrum voor Teksteditie en Bronnenstudie - CTB) has launched the
 DALF project. DALF is an acronym for "Digital Archive of Letters by Flemish authors
 and composers from the 19th & 20th century". It is envisioned as a growing textbase
 of correspondence material which can generate different products for both academia
 and a wider audience, and thus provide a tool for diverse research disciplines ranging
 from literary criticism to historical, diachronic, synchronic, and sociolinguistic
 research. The input of this textbase will consist of the materials produced in separate
 electronic edition projects. The DALF project can be expected to stimulate new electronic
 edition projects, as well as the international debate on electronic editions of manuscripts.
 
 
 
 



Implementation description:
 In order to ensure maximum flexibility and (re)usability of each of the electronic
 DALF editions, a formal framework is required that can guarantee uniform integration
 of new projects in the DALF project. Therefore, the project is from the start aimed
 at adherence to international standards for electronic text encoding. An important
 formal standard used in the DALF project is XML, that enables the definition of structural
 text-grammars as Document Type Definitions (DTD). Also in the construction of such
 a DTD that is suitable for scientific markup of correspondence material, we tried
 to align with international efforts to define markup schemes. Without going into detail
 here, the insights and practices presented in international projects like TEI (Text
 Encoding Initiative), Master (Manuscript Access through Standards for Electronic Records),
 and MEP (Model Editions Partnership) were taken into consideration for the implementation
 of following requirements in a DTD for correspondence material:
 
 
 
 First, the DTD should be designed for the transcription of primary source material,
 from which letter editions can be generated. In view of this requirement, the work
 by the Model Editions Partnership proved of little use, since it is aimed at the digitisation
 of existing letter editions in print.
 
 Second, the DTD should allow to store detailed metadata about the transcribed document.
 This is the point where Master proved useful.
 
 Third, the DTD should be able to cater for letter-specific features, such as the previously
 mentioned envelope information, the postscript etc.
 
 Fourth, the DTD should allow for a general application to letter transcriptions and
 editions and should not restrict itself to the specific corpus of letters we are currently
 working on.
 
 
 
 The TEI encoding scheme provides an excellent starting point for many of the features
 one would like to encode in letters. Yet, letters have a number of specific elements
 that require additional encoding means. Since the TEI scheme can be extended when
 necessary, this is the approach taken for the development of the DALF DTD.
