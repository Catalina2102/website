# Early Irish Glossaries Database




* Host: Dept of Anglo-Saxon, Norse, and Celtic, University of Cambridge
* URL: <http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/irishglossaries/>



Description:
 The website presents a database of the headwords in the three main early Irish glossaries.
 The datbase can be used in several ways; e.g. to create concordances, search for attestations
 of particular words, etc.



Implementation description:
 It forms the preliminary to a three-year AHRC funded project in the Dept of ASNC (started
 1 July 2006) to edit the early Irish glossaries. It is intended not only for those
 with an interest in medieval Irish literature and texts but also for those with interests
 in the field of medieval learned discourse.
