**General description:** The (Brevier Reports), published biennially from 1858 to 1887, are verbatim reports
 of the legislative history of the Indiana General Assembly that also include messages
 from the
 Governor, biographical sketches of legislative members, lists of enacted legislation
 and more. The Brevier Reports capture the impact of significant historical events
 surrounding the Civil War along with other issues before the Indiana General Assembly.
 This is a unique set of documents — there exists no other such detailed and comprehensive
 record of the debate and speeches delivered from the floor of the Indiana Senate chamber
 and the Hall of the House of Representatives for this time period.
 
 **Implementation description:** Twenty two bibliographic volumes some 200–700 pages in length were converted to full
 text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, Abbyy Reader, and encoded
 at the volume-level following the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, version
 P5, adhering as much as possible to Level 3 of the Best Practices for TEI in Libraries
 (<http://purl.org/TEI/teiinlibraries>) [1]. The TEI/XML files for each volume are available for downloading. To learn more
 about general encoding strategies and
 challenges visit the Encoding Overview: <http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/brevier/projectinfo/encoding.do>. The delivery and discovery capabilities of this site are implemented using a customized
 version of the open source
 eXtensible Text Framework (XTF) developed by the California Digital Library. It is
 served using the Tomcat application server and Apache HTTP Server software. Local
 customizations to XTF at Indiana University include a unique native page image viewer
 and a page turner that are both driven exclusively by the information encoded in the
 source TEI files and require no additional software beyond what can be accomplished
 by customizing XTF's XSLT templates. This feature enables switching between text and
 page images at any time while navigating a document's structure, and allows viewing
 of one or more page images as moveable overlays simultaneously with the text in the
 paged text mode. The actual page images are stored and delivered via the IU Digital
 Library Program's Fedora repository. The site also
 uses a newer XTF feature called sub-document indexing. This allows encoding entire
 volumes of the Brevier Legislative Reports as the source TEI documents yet enables
 access at more granular levels. In this case, search and browse results are not the
 full volumes as they exist in the XTF library but are instead TEI divisions within
 the volumes representing such things as legislative days, indices, or supplementary
 materials. Following an item link in a search result retrieves the sub-document in
 context to the volume in its entirety.
