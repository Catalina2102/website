Description:
 John Foxe (1517-87) fled to the Continent during the reign of Mary I, and on
 his return, wrote a history of the English Protestant martyrs from the 14th
 century to his own time. Usually known as The Book of Martyrs, it traces the
 triumph of Protestantism through the sufferings of English Protestants.
 
 This 'Category One Research Project' of the British Academy is producing a
 new, definitive edition of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the English
 Martyrs, based on a textual reconstruction of the four editions published in
 Foxe's lifetime. The electronic edition of the Acts and Monuments is true in
 structure and content to the 1583 edition (the last for which Foxe was
 personally responsible). The textual development, using the 1583 edition as
 the base text, will be indicated, and a full apparatus criticus will be
 included.
 
 The site currently on line is still under development, with material
 continuously being added.
