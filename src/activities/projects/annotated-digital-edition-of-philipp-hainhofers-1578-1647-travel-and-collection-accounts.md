# Annotated Digital Edition of Philipp Hainhofer’s (1578-1647) Travel and Collection Accounts



**Host:** Herzog August Bibliothek
**URL:** <http://diglib.hab.de/?link=078>

**Description:** The Augsburg citizen Philipp Hainhofer was the leading agent for art objects as well
 as for political and cultural information in the first half of the 17th century north
 of the Alps. As “cultural broker” he constantly crossed denominational and political
 boundaries. There was a versatile exchange between his mercantile, diplomatic-political,
 and academic correspondence, his travel accounts and description of artworks for courtly
 recipients, his complex Kunstkammerschränke and his trading with art objects, other
 luxuries, books and manuscripts, which outlined content and structure of the respective
 areas of activity. In this manner Hainhofer created classified microcosms as an answer
 to a denominational and political world drifting apart on the eve of the Thirty Years’
 War.

Hainhofer’s above mentioned spheres of action were converged in his travel accounts.
 They form the core of his written inheritance and provide a large store for art historical
 and historical research in the early modern period as well as related disciplines
 and this in a rich diversity concerning the study of residencies, collections, courtly,
 nobility, and ceremonial culture, travel and art literature, cultural exchange and
 material culture, and history of diplomacy and politics just to mention a few.

This project will present Hainhofer’s complete travel accounts for the first time
 in an annotated digital edition. It is intended to provide a modern and complex documentation
 of his travels with renditions of the originals, full text, extensive critical instruments
 and annotations of text and image and cartographic addendum.

Besides the long-awaited complete and systematical indexing of Hainhofer’s travel
 accounts, the project serves two conceptual-structural academic approaches. One is
 that it aims at focusing on the question of function and importance of cultural agency
 and transfer in the pan-European area during increased political and denominational
 conflicts, the other is that it wishes to apply an interdisciplinary approach in which
 the different fields of study are combined to the same degree."
