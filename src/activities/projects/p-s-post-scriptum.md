General description: Within the P.S. (Post Scriptum)
 Project, systematic research will be developed, along with
 the publishing and historical-linguistic study of private
 letters written in Portugal and Spain along the Modern Ages.
 These documents are unpublished epistolary writings, written
 by authors from different social backgrounds. They could be
 either masters or servants, adults or children, men or women,
 thieves, soldiers, artisans, priests, political activists,
 among other kinds of social agents. Their epistolarity
 survived by chance, when their paths met the persecution
 means used by the Inquisition and the civil courts, two
 institutions that used private correspondence as criminal
 evidence. The documents, which are part of court proceedings,
 can be taken as near sociological interviews, conducted by
 inquisitors and judges, which allows researchers to reach a
 more adequate contextualization of the inter-personal
 relations in traditional societies. These textual resources
 often present an (almost) oral rhetoric, treating everyday
 issues of past centuries in a register that hasn't been easy
 to study, apart from brief examples. Not only does the P.S.
 Project present a wide collection of private letters, but it
 also makes its philological treatment available in an online
 digital edition, along with linguistics and cultural
 monographs. The project is funded by the European Research
 Council (7FP/ERC Advanced Grant - GA 295562).
