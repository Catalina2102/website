Description:
 A forthcoming edition of approximately 2000 Greek and Latin inscriptions from the
 province of Cyrenaica (the eastern part of modern Libya),
 from the Roman and late antique periods. Inscriptions were recorded by Joyce Reynolds
 between 1948 and 2008.
 The project was funded from 2007-2010. A first edition of about half of the material
 should be made available in early 2012.



Implementation description:
 The inscriptions are encoded according to the EpiDoc guidelines and DTD (<http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/>).
