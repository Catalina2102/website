Description:
 This collection provides digital access to contracts between the United Farm Workers
 Union AFL-CIO and California growers spanning about 30 years. The project is a collaboration
 between the Digital Initiatives Program and the Agricultural and Resource Economics
 Library. The goal of the project is to provide researchers with access to a searchable
 and browseable collection of otherwise elusive materials. At the present time, there
 are 60 contracts available online of approximately 120 to be completed. Contracts
 are in English, Spanish and Spanish/English.



Implementation description:
 The electronic texts are created in XML using the TEIXLITE DTD, without modification,
 and are shown in XML, HTML and PDF formats on the website.
