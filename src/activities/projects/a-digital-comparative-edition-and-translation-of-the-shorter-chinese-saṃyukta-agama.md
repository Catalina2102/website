Description:
 The Bieyi za ahan jing 別譯雜阿含經 (BZA) in 16 fascicles consists of 364 sutras and belongs
 to the early Chinese Buddhist texts collectively called Ahan (Āgama) sutras 阿含經. Āgama
 literature constitutes the earliest stratum of Buddhist literature. The originals
 (in Buddhist Sanskrit) are largely lost, only a few fragments have survived. Next
 to the Chinese tradition only the Theravāda tradition has preserved a comprehensive
 set of these sutras in Pāli. Generally, all of the 364 short sutras contained the
 BZA have at least one parallel in Chinese and one Pāli parallel (with commentary).
 Often there are several parallels in Chinese and Pāli, sometimes even a fragment in
 Buddhist Sanskrit has survived. The aim of the project is to create a digital comparative
 edition of the BZA, which connects these text-clusters.
 
 The end-user selects the cluster s/he wants to view online and can further select
 which of the texts in the cluster to display, provisionally in a three column layout.
 
 The Project has started in 2005 and is expected to finish all clusters in 2008.



Implementation description:
 The sutra texts are encoded in TEI P5 with a DTD/Schema that restricts some content
 models, but does not add any elements. They should validate with any plain-vanilla
 TEI P5 Schema. The source files for each text are available on the website.
 
 Middleware between the source files and the user application is eXist (on Tomcat 5.5)
 with XSLT and XQuery, from which the user generates a view of a cluster in her browser.

Access :

 are used under an agreement with the Vipassana Research Institute at Dhammagiri, India.
 The Sanskrit texts were made available by Fumio Enomoto.
