Description:
 The ASPP is a collaborative effort to present examples of Anglo-Saxon poetry and varied
 translations in the electronic context of the World Wide Web. We provide a suggested
 method for coding and tagging Anglo-Saxon Poetry using the Text Encoding Initiative
 (TEI) standard.



Implementation description:
 The inherent challenges of presenting a comparative tool for Anglo-Saxon are evident;
 online visual representation and electronic preservation of the uniqueness of Old
 English multiplies the challenge exponentially. For clarity and standardization of
 tagging and simplicity of presentation, the TEI standards of XML best preserve the
 poems. The extensible nature of TEI will also accommodate increasing complexity of
 tagging associated with research, analysis and data processing concerns. The collaborative
 nature of the ASPP is served well by dynamic pages permitting contribution from interested
 scholars.
