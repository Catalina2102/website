Description:
 The Szeged Corpus is a manually annotated natural language corpus, currently comprising
 1.2 million words plus 225 thousand punctuation marks. Texts of the corpus derive
 from six different topic areas: short business news, daily news, fiction, law, texts
 related to computer science, and compositions of 14 to 16 year-old students. Corpus
 texts have gone through different phases of natural language analysis, such as morpho-syntactic
 analysis, POS tagging, shallow syntactic parsing, and semantic annotation. Current
 works aim at a more detailed syntactic analysis of the texts, including the annotation
 of adverbial, preverbal, postpositional, and adjectival structures and the identification
 of verbs and their argument structures. With this, the consortium intends to lay the
 foundation of a Hungarian treebank which is planned to be enriched with detailed semantic
 information as well at a later stage. Different versions of the Szeged Corpus are
 publicly available after on-line registration and can be used for educational and
 research purposes free of charge. For more information visit the http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/hlt
 web site.



Implementation description:
 The format of the corpus files is XML and their inner structure is first described
 by the TEIXLITE DTD, then TEI P4 DTD.
