General description: Published continuously since 1905, the
 is one of the nation's
 oldest historical journals. Since 1913, the IMH has
 been edited and published quarterly at Indiana
 University, Bloomington. Today, the IMH features
 peer-reviewed articles, research notes, annotated
 primary documents, reviews, and critical essays that
 contribute to public and scholarly understanding of
 midwestern and Indiana history.



Implementation description:
 Encoding the IMH came with its own sets
 of challenges due to the variety of content types
 included within the journal, and the changes in
 structure over its 102-year print history. In addition
 to scholarly articles, tables of contents, indexes, and
 other text types commonly found in journals, the text
 of the IMH contains reprints of primary source
 materials from letters and diaries to election results.
 The presence of tabular data and highly structured text
 such as poetry posed structural difficulties, while
 foreign languages and a proliferation of proper names
 created the need for focused semantic encoding.
 

 For the purpose of this project, the semantic encoding
 focused on article types (scholarly, book reviews, and
 editorial materials), article features (diaries,
 letters, and bibliographies) and place names.
 Structural encoding focused on basic print conventions
 for serials such as page breaks, bylines, etc. as well
 as lists, tables, blockquotes and footnotes.
 

 The encoding required to faithfully represent the text
 would have been prohibitively expensive, and was
 furthermore unnecessary due to the facsimile page
 images provided. Certain structural elements such as
 columns and verse, and semantic elements such as
 personal names and back matter indices were not encoded
 for these reasons.
 

 Issue-level encoding following the Guidelines for
 Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange, version P4
 was employed to maintain the conceptual integrity of
 the print journal. Like most journals, articles in the
 IMH have two sets of bibliographic metadata:
 issue-level and article-level. The journal also
 contains book review articles, consisting of multiple
 reviews, each with its own set of metadata. In order to
 provide readers with issue-level browse access and
 article-level search access (e.g., search by article
 title or author), bibliographic metadata was captured
 for the issue and for each of the articles, including
 discrete book reviews, within the issue by way of
 independent headers.
