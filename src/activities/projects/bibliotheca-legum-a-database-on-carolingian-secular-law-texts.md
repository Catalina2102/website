title: "Bibliotheca legum. A Database on Carolingian Secular Law Texts"
---



**Host:** University of Cologne (Germany)
**URL:** <http://www.leges.uni-koeln.de/en/>
**Description:** The *Bibliotheca legum* project is intended to provide an overview of the handwritten production of secular
 law texts and thus of the legal knowledge widespread in the medieval Frankish Empire.
 Not only codifications or legal codes that were valid in the Francia are included,
 but also all secular law texts copied there during this period. Therefor, descriptions 
 of manuscripts (> 320) containing the so-called leges are presented on the website.
 In addition, the database also offers contextualizing information and tries - for
 example by means of a comprehensive bibliography - to present the current state of
 research as completely as possible. External resources such as online catalogues and
 digital images are also included.
