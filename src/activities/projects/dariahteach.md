**General description**: #dariahTeach is a learning platform (developed in Moodle environment) hosting open source, community-driven, high quality, multilingual teaching materials for the digital arts and humanities. Funded through an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership Grant, the project aimed in developing high quality teaching materials for asynchronous learning and in strengthening alliances and fostering innovative teaching and learning practices among members of the ESFRI-roadmap Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) network.
