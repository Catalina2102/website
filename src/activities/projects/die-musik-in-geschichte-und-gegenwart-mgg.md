General description: MGG Online will include the content
 of the 1994–2008 print edition of MGG as well as future
 updates, revisions, and additions which will be made using
 the TEI-edition of FontoXML. Regular updates will guarantee
 that MGG remains musicology’s foremost reference work. All
 entries from this widely consulted and cited encyclopedia
 will be accessible to users through the new online database
 beginning in 2017.
 

 For over half a century the abbreviation MGG has stood for
 the reference work Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart.
 Friedrich Blume was the founding editor of the first edition
 of MGG, which was published by Bärenreiter from 1949 to 1986.
 The second edition, edited by Ludwig Finscher, appeared
 between 1994 and 2008 as a co-production of Bärenreiter and
 J.B. Metzler; it comprises 29 volumes and 25,000 pages, with
 approximately 20,000 articles written by over 3500 authors
 from 55 countries. MGG offers well-researched and
 authoritative texts on almost every aspect of music, as well
 as numerous professional directories, bibliographies, tables,
 figures, and indexes. As its original subtitle suggests, MGG
 is in the fullest sense a universal encyclopedia of
 music.
