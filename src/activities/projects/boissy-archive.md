General description: The basic objective of the project is to provide a digital edition of the works
 of the French playwright Louis de Boissy (1694-1758), ideally of the entirety of his
 production (including translations in other languages, writings for the Mercure de
 France, speeches, songs and poems).
 
A more ambitious objective is to experiment with enriched encoding, destined to support
 new forms of distant readings for the study of the theater. Basic encoding and existent
 tools, such as Philologic and TXM, while rendering very important services to the
 scholarly community, are either not very rich from a semantic point of view, or more
 adapted for linguistic studies. Literary scholars may want to ask questions about
 the persistence of types and topoi, about character building, intertextual effects,
 etc., and the aim of the project is to reflect upon the needs in terms of conceptualisation
 and upon the technical solutions allowing to answer them.
 





Implementation description:
 The texts have been encoded keeping in mind the needs of various disciplines, hence
 the use of a quite large set of tags:
 
 - those developed for the theatrical texts;
 
 - but also a (partial) encoding of punctuation and orthographical variations, of interest
 for the historians of the language.
 
 The most recent added plays contain also some feature libraries, destined to fine
 encode characters and "caractérisèmes".
