General description: is an
 electronic edition of poetry by the Dadaist artist,
 performer, and poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.
 Work on this digital edition began as part of the
 dissertation entitled "The Makings of Digital
 Modernism" by Tanya Clement. A portion of the
 dissertation is included here as the essay
 "Knowledge Representation and the Networked Text in
 In Transition." This scholarly edition comprises
 digital surrogates and transcriptions of multiple
 manuscript versions of twelve poems by
 Freytag-Loringhoven. The manuscripts are housed in
 the Papers of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, which
 are among the holdings in Special Collections of
 the University of Maryland (UM), College Park,
 Libraries.



Implementation description:
 Tanya Clement created the digital
 surrogates of the manuscripts and transcribed and
 encoded them in TEI P5 XML, using parallel
 segmentation. In addition, Clement augmented this
 instantiation with the free, open-source Javascript
 application called the Versioning Machine (v.4.0),
 which underlies the interface and allows for the
 cross-comparisons between these digital
 surrogates.
