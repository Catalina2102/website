Description:


"English Poetry is a machine-readable full-text database including 4,450 works of
 poets from the Anglo-Saxon period to the end of the nineteenth century, available
 commercially from Chadwyck-Healey. The great size and chronological span of English
 Poetry and the consistent coding of all the texts make it a valuable resource for
 research, teaching and reference."


"The SGML encoding scheme to be used by English Poetry is closely modelled on that
 being developed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), the international research
 project sponsored by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association
 for Literary and Linguistic Computing and the Association for Computational Linguistics,
 and jointly funded by the US National Endowment for the Humanities, the Commission
 of the European Communities (DG XIII) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.


The two TEI editors are also members of the editorial board for English Poetry."
