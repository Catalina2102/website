# Boccaccio's Decameron

**Description:** The Decameron Web project was started in the academic year 1994–95, and is a collaboration
 between the Italian Studies Department and the Scholarly Technology Group. The STG
 developed a DTD based on the TEI-Lite, and digitization was carried out by staff at
 the STG and graduate students of the Italian Studies Department.
 
 The Decameron is now available online, and includes the full text of the original
 text in Italian and English, and secondary sources. Searches can be applied to the
 whole text or specific sections. Additional encoding has been added to support searches
 for gender, occupation and social role of named characters.
