Description:


Perseus is an evolving digital library which currently focuses upon the ancient Greek
 world. Planning for Perseus began in 1985. The first edition, for Macintosh, was published
 on CD-ROM in 1992, through Yale University Press. The second edition (2000) operates
 on PC and Macintosh platforms. 


Perseus contains transcriptions and translations of many Greek, a growing number of
 Latin sources, and Renaissance works in English. A range of text analysis tools are
 built into Perseus, primarily for working with the Greek texts. Perseus also contains
 a large body of art and archaeology resources, and background information on the ancient
 world. In total, it has a catalogue of 25,000 images of architecture, sculpture, coins,
 vases, and sites, and an extensive collection of atlases, maps, and plans. 


Perseus has received funding through the Digital Libraries Initiative (phase 2) to
 become the Digital Library for the Humanities. The new project will expand its collections
 to cover a wider range of subjects, explore and develop tools to support complex searching
 and information retrieval, and to evaluate the impact of digital libraries on learning.
 Greg Crane has an article on Perseus and the new digital library in a recent edition
 of D-Lib Magazine (number 6, 7/8) [Designing documents to enhance the performance of digital libraries: Time, space,
 people, and a digital library on London](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july00/crane/07crane.html).
