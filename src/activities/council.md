# Technical Council

The TEI Technical Council is responsible for the development and maintenance of the TEI Guidelines and related TEI systems and resources. It recommends, evaluates, and implements new features and modifications of existing
features, and supervises the overall development of each new version of the *Guidelines*. At the TEI annual members' meeting, the Council presents a [report on current work](Reports/), and minutes are available from
the [meetings](Meetings/) of the Council as well. The [archives
of the mailing list](http://lists.tei-c.org/pipermail/tei-council/) are publicly accessible and ongoing and past work can be seen in [the TEI's GitHub site](https://github.com/TEIC).

The TEI Technical Council consists of eleven members elected to
staggered three-year terms by the TEI membership at the Annual Meeting. The
Council meets twice a year in person, and holds a Zoom conference call
every month.
