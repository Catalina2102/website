The TEI-C Infrastructure Group (IG) is responsible for the infrastructure behind the TEI-C's services and web presence. It was formed in 2019 in response to the substantial technical problems surfacing at that time.


Most of the services are now running on the French Research Infrastructure [Huma-Num](https://www.huma-num.fr/) based in Lyon. This includes


* TEI Website
* TEI Wiki
* TEI Vault
* Subversion for jTEI
* TEIGarage
* TEI Open Journal Systems
* Roma


Additional services are hosted by the Brown University, the University of Maryland, the University of Paderborn, and the University of Victoria. A full list of the inventory can be found below.
Current members of the group are Elisa Beshero-Bondar, Hugh Cayless, James Cummings, Martin Holmes, Laurent Romary, Martina Scholger, Sabine Seifert, Peter Stadler, Ron Van den Branden, and Raff Viglianti.


If you encounter any issues concerning the TEI-C's infrastructure, please contact [infrastructuregroup@tei-c.org](mailto:infrastructuregroup@tei-c.org).
