 were reviewed
 
 P5 "Howto"
* + Draft had been reviewed and
	 updated and was now thought to be ready for
	 prime time: it should be moved from the Drafts section of

	 published on the Wiki. JCReview
	 and then disseminate the P5 howto.2005\-12\-31


XPointer scheme registration

	 succeded in registering the TEI scheme, modulo some need
	 to choose between xpath and
	 xpath1 as a name.


BIBL

	 say this action on SB was "deliberately deferred" but it
	 seems to have vanished without trace!].


Datatypes
* + All actions
	 completed.


lbl vs label
* + LB reported no action, pending
	 discussion with LR


stylesheet problems
* + SR reported stylesheets had
	 been fixed to make
	 `xml:id` now visible and section numbering now more
	 rational in HTML version of P5 Guidelines: this won't be visible to
	 the world until next release however


g availability
* Done



Review of WG etc. progressPB: Physical Bibliography
* + CW had received an update from Murray McGilvray which he would
	 circulate to Council: not much progress yet.


SO: segmentation \& alignment

	 the status of its deliverables seemed a little unclear. SB
	 was asked to investigate and report. SB2005\-12\-31
	 Circulate summary report on SO workgroup outputs to date


FS: feature structures
* + LB reported that the draft had now been ratified by
	 ISO. The new work item on feature system declaration had
	 been accepted, and a meeting had been proposed to start the
	 work in Korea on 16 Jan; LB was however unable to attend.


General
* CW noted that the list of activities on
 the web site was out of date; LB made the traditional comment that web
 site maintenance was not the editors' job.LBto update the Activities
 webpage asap. It was noted that no other work groups were still
 active.



New Work Item: personographyAs informally discussed in Sofia, LB had recently completed
 some minor changes to the
 available elements for recording data about persons and
 introduced a new listPerson element. SR, Matthew
 Driscoll, and he had discussed how best to take the work
 forward, and come to the conclusion that it might be worth
 paying a student to undertake some preliminary survey work
 before convening a small meeting on the topic.
 
 SR noted that the board had allocated $24K to the Council for the
 current financial year; if half that was devoted to the May meeting, a
 budget of $6K for each of two workgroups would be feasible.
 
 Several Council members expressed interest in contributing to the
 work. After discussion, Council agreed to ask Matthew Driscoll to
 chair the activity with a fixed budget of $6K. CW, LBDraft charge for personography
 activity, including deadlines and workplan.2005\-12\-31
 
 
New Work Item: PageImagesFollowing recent discussion on the council list, it was agreed
 that
 there was a need to document TEI best practice with respect to the
 management of texts including or consisting of digitized page images,
 given the wide variety of current practice. Conall agreed to take on
 the task of producing a preliminary draft, and making it available for
 further discussion via the TEI wiki.CTInitiate and facilitate production of
 note on Page Image Management; report on progress to next Council
 meeting. 2006\-02\-24
 
 
P5 progressLB had previously circulated the following brief note:
 
 * During October there was extensive
 work on attributes and datatypes, which was completed in time
 for a release of P5 (0\.2\.1\) to take place on the 21st.
* During November, the priority was to work on classes. A
 detailed programme of work was agreed following the Council meeting in
 Oxford, and is now complete. Full details of the changes made are
 available from http://www.tei\-c.org/Drafts/edw92\.xml
* Some outstanding issues remain on the class front, in particular there is still need
 for a review of many chapters not discussed at the Oxford meeting. Enough work has
 been done, however, to proceed to the revision of chapter ST, which is the next priority.
* In December, Matthew Driscoll visited Oxford, resulting in a number of minor corrections
 to the MS chapter.
* A new "listPerson" element has been introduced to facilitate encoding of "personographical"
 data: this was tested on some data supplied by Matthew which now forms a new component
 of the test suite.
* New material for inclusion in chapters SA and NH has been received but not yet reviewed
 by both editors.


 Discussing this, Council noted that the legend "done" in EDW92
 meant that the change had been applied in CVS. A new full release
 would include these changes; it was agreed that the next release
 should also include a less misleading version of chapter ST, much of
 which is currently plain wrong. LB
 Ensure that ST corrections are completed
 2006\-01\-31
 
 Council discussed how best to take forward the outstanding work on
 revising class memberships, in particular how to repeat the Oxford
 process for chapters other than core, header, structure. Possibilities
 included another ftf meeting for the same group, a series of
 conference calls taking each module one at a time, email list etc. A
 specific proposal was requested. SB
 organize a proposal on how best to prosecute the class struggle 2005\-12\-31
 
 

 
 Annual FTF Meeting
 
 Council agreed that a meeting mid\-May in Kyoto would be
 its first preference. Travel costs could be reduced if this
 were held in conjunction with some kind of TEI Training
 event. CWInvestigate
 options for holding council meeting/TEI training meeting in
 Kyoto, reporting back by next call. 2006\-02\-24
 
 SS offered facilities at MITH, in the Washington area, should this
 not be possible. Paris and Oxford were also available, as
 previously.
 
 

 
 AOB
 
 PW reported that the "TEI in Libraries" group was now working as
 part of the US Digital Library Foundation, and wouild be holding a
 meeting next month in Washington to update its now rather elderly
 Guidelines on best practice in using the TEI. These Guidelines will
 continue to be based on TEI P4\. It was suggested that they could
 nevertheless be usefully enhanced with a section on preparing for
 P5 or some such, which should highlight any potential problems in
 migration from P4 to P5 for the library community. SB (and other
 Council members) will be
 attending this meeting and was asked to report back from it. SB/SS/NSReport back from TEI Libraries
 meeting at next TEI Council call. 2006\-02\-24
 
 
Next CallThe date of 24 Feb at the same time was proposed.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Call ended at 13:10 or thereabouts.
