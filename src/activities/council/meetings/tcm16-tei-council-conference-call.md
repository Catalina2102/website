# TCM16: TEI Council Conference Call





All Council members were present, except LR who had sent
 apologies; SB arrived late





Review of Actions
 
 The following action items from the [previous minutes](/Activities/Council/Meetings/tcm15.xml) were reviewed:
 


Stylesheet call* JF had produced notes,
 and these had been discussed. It had been suggested that MZ
 might set up a WIKI to host process at NYU. Chair queried
 whether this would not be better done on the main TEI site. JF
 agreed this would be desirable, but it was not yet clear
 how this fitted in with UVA's website development plans. SR
 noted that the choice of site supporting the WIKI did not
 matter so long as the address wiki.tei\-c.org (or
 tei\-c.org/wiki) could be mapped to it. 
 
 JF
 to pursue wiki redirection with DP and report.
 
 2005\-04\-10
P5 Editing Environment* LB reported that
 he had received input from most Council members and was
 working on a draft HowTo document to help testers get
 started. Council stressed the importance of making such a
 document available as soon (and as widely) as
 possible. Noted that the document would need input from
 those with access to non\-Unix platforms and expertise in
 other editors.
 
 LB
 to circulate preliminary draft of HowTo document within
 next two weeks
 
 2005\-04\-10
P5 delivery* SR reported that he had
 drafted a document on P5 system maintenance with
 information useful for those trying to use the supplied P5
 Makefile. Council agreed that this topic also needed to be
 addressed, and that a simple README for P5 would also be
 useful. 
 
 JC
 to draft README for P5 source files
 
 2005\-04\-10

 LB stated that investigation into how best to install P5 in
 non\-Linux platforms was also needed.
Editorial Committee* LB reported that there had
 been some feedback on this, but not as yet enough to warrant setting
 up a committee distinct from the Council.




 Activity Reports
 
 StandOff WG* SB reported complete inactivity from
 the group. Council noted that the current SA chapter still needed
 a considerable amount of explanatory and editorial work.
ISO\-FS* LB reported that the DIS was now out for
 national ballot within ISO member organizations
Phys Bib WG* JF reported that she had approached
 ODonnell to head this wg, who had declined; she was pursuing other
 possibilities. The group had however made some preliminary suggestions which
 could be considered for inclusion in P5: it was agreed that this
 should be circulated to Council for comment.
 
 JF
 to circulate informal report on suggestions so far
 produced by PhysBib wg to Council.
 
 2005\-04\-10
BiblItem* PW had had some discussion with members
 of the group about the nature of the new proposal. LB expressed
 concern that the existing 
 biblStruct element should not be
 removed from P5 until there had been opportunity to compare the two
 proposals; this was agreed. SB and PW were requested to collect
 and report on the issues. A link to the relevant documents and
 proposals should be available from the Activities web page, and the
 matter discussed at the next Council meeting. LB reported that the
 basic ideas had been well received by INIST at the meeting he had
 recently attended in Nancy.
 
 PW
 to report on biblItem proposals to Council.
 
 2005\-04\-15
Metadata Standards* JW and NS were poised to request input from cataloguers for
 production of a TEI Header/MARC
 cross\-walk using a spreadsheet. Council requested that this should also be made available
 for
 review via the Activities web page.
 
 JW
 to provide draft report for posting on website.
 
 2005\-04\-05
Manuscript description* MD reported that he and LB had a preliminary list of potential
 reviewers for the new MS material and hoped to send it out within the
 next two weeks, as soon as supporting documentation was
 available. There had been some minor changes to the draft in response
 to comments received since the first release, and more were
 anticipated. Council approved the suggested review method,
 recommending that reviewers be asked to file individual reports within
 a short timescale, and that feedback provided should also be circulated to the
 existing MS\-SIG list. It was noted that dealing with comments might
 require considerable effort.
 
 MD
 to progress review procedure for MS chapter
 
 2005\-04\-12




 Work on P5
 
 Council considered three documents concerning next stages
 of work on TEI P5: [../Drafts/edw81\.xml](../Drafts/edw81.xml), [../Drafts/edw86\.xml](../Drafts/edw86.xml) and [../Drafts/edw87\.xml](../Drafts/edw87.xml). The first sets out the current
 state of the various chapters of P5\. It had been proposed that each council
 member should attempt to review at least one chapter before the
 Paris meeting. There was some discussion about the nature of
 review required, and the stability of the current version of P5,
 in which some systematic changes were still anticipated. It was
 agreed that chapters should be reviewed primarily for content,
 in line with the draft suggestions for MS reviewers (circulated
 to Council for comment by LB in an email of 29 March). Council
 members were requested to notify the chair of their preferences
 by suggesting up to three chapters in preference order. 
 
 ALL
 to send CW a list of their chapter preferences
 
 2005\-04\-3

CW
 to collate stated preferences and send out list of chapter
 assignments
 
 2005\-04\-8




ED86 and EDW87 contain both suggested design principles and
 lists of attributes or elements affected by their proposed
 application. The former concerns (primarily) text\-valued attributes
 and the latter concerns class membership. In discussion of EDW81, it
 was agreed that attributes replaced by child elements should not be
 retained also as attributes. A question was raised about what policy
 should apply to cases where attributes were being transformed into
 child elements for elements which already had child content, in
 particular mixed content. Lack of time prevented detailed discussion
 of the documents. 


 Council endorsed the
 general direction of the principles proposed and agreed that they
 should be discussed in more detail at the Paris meeting, with a view
 to proceeding directly to implementation of the principles thereafter.
 
 ALL
 to review documents EDW86 and EDW87 in detail, raising
 any queries by email as soon as possible.
 
 2005\-04\-26






 Next Meeting
 
 As previously agreed, the Council will hold its annual face to face
 meeting at AFNOR in Paris, starting at 1400 on 28 April. The
 aim is to complete the meeting by Friday 29th evening, but the
 morning of Saturday 30th will be available if necessary.
