 Brief Reports 
 
 
 TEI Tite (KH) 
 
 
 KH has been trying to synchronize the Apex and TEI versions of Tite. There
 are things in the Apex prose docs that don't match their DTD, but Apex will
 accept a new DTD whenever we provide it, so KH suggested we just give them
 the latest version. According to SR, there is only one difference between
 the actual DTDs. LB: Should we give them a new ODD \+ schema, or just a DTD?
 If we give them both, then the ODD should provide documentation to replace
 theirs. KH: Their documentation is different and a bit more thorough and
 precise than ours. LB: We should take their documentation and place it in
 our ODD, if they'll allow us to do so. KH will look more closely at this. 




 SIG Reports (JC)
 
 JC already circulated a report to the Council list. Some SIGs have responded,
 others not. This is available on the tei\-council mailing list at [http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei\-council/2012/016088\.html](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2012/016088.html).
 KH reports from [the Libraries SIG](/Activities/SIG/Libraries/): 
 they are beginning a study of the library community
 to see how/whether they are using TEI and how well TEI is meeting their needs.
 The results will be presented at TEI and at another conference in the fall.
 Question for Council: we agreed in Ann Arbor that KH should go through the Best
 Practices document and create tickets based on it. He hasn't started that
 yet, but proposes asking members of the 


TEI for Libraries list to help. For
 this, he'd like either a category or a group in SF for those tickets. LB:
 what sort of tickets would arise out of this? It sounds more like a tutorial
 for fine\-tuning the TEI for libraries. JC: There's already a category in SF
 for TEI Guidelines Documentation. JC: Making a category is permanent is SF,
 so we should probably avoid making new ones that would only be of temporary
 value. KH withdrew the idea in the light of this. But if someone can come up
 with a category that means “not ready for Council consideration yet”, then
 that might be handy. LB suggests using a wiki to create the list of topics
 and issues, and then create tickets from that. 
 
  JC mentioned ongoing board discussions about reforming the way SIGs worked
 and that currently the SIG Rules [http://www.tei\-c.org/Activities/SIG/rules.xml](/Activities/SIG/rules.xml) say that “a single
 ‘SIG Coordinator' is appointed by the Council from among its members”. He
 has suggested (and will suggest again to the board) that it should not be
 limited to the Council Membership. 




 Google Books (KH)
 
  KH has obtained samples of Google TEI output and circulated them to Council,
 but nobody has had a chance to look at them yet. KH will remind Council to
 do this. 




 Physical Bibliography (KH)
 
  In Paris we thought it would be a good idea to revive the PB working group,
 and there are complaints that TEI inadequately serves the PB community for
 printed books. KH has found Annika Rockenberger who is willing to serve as
 leader of the working group, and has asked her to formulate a plan that he
 can bring to Council for approval. Hopefully this will be available for the
 September F2F. 




 ODD Meeting after DH2012 (JC)
 
 A brief report has been sent to the Council list [http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei\-council/2012/016074\.html](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2012/016074.html);
 JC summarized its contents. LB noted that the report needs to be condensed
 into some take\-home messages. MH wondered Re: the Roma issue: was it mainly
 the web interface or the back\-end? JC noted that everyone there agreed that
 there should be a second, independent implementation of Roma. But SR is
 mainly concerned that we need an new web interface that handles more of the
 ODD functionality. 



Action: JC will be producing a clearer, more summary, report
 or the face2face meeting. 




 XPointer scheme proposal (GB) 
 
 
 GB was unable to connect owing to telephonic difficulties. 
 MH and LB discussed the XPointer scheme proposal written by Hugh Cayless for
 the benefit of council. MH finds it hard to advocate for it since he
 is worried about the scale and ambition of it, and not sure whether, in the end,
 it would be useful or much used. It is suggested PB should see if this fits his use\-cases.
 MH suggests only looking at those pointer schemes which are actually in use
 in the wild, but the proposers want to handle theoretical ones. Not enough
 Council members had yet read the proposal which is at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JsMA\-gOGrevyY\-crzHGiC7eZ8XdV5H\_wFTlUGzrf20w/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JsMA-gOGrevyY-crzHGiC7eZ8XdV5H_wFTlUGzrf20w/edit).
 More discussion is needed on council list, and feeding back of any
 suggestions to the creators of the proposal in case they wish to modify it
 before the next council FTF meeting.




 Face2Face Meeting: arrangements (JC) 
 
 Reminder to put these things into diaries so no conflicts arise. JC will
 provide lots more info for everyone nearer the time. LB: Where are the
 meetings? JC: IT Services and Wolfson College. We can't have it all in
 either place because of conflicts. KH looks forward to visiting the fabled
 OUCS\-that\-was. JC promises a tour with highlights like "This is where Lou's
 office used to be". Everyone needing accommodation says they've already
 booked it. 





 Replacement for Stuart Yeates or not? (JC) 
 
  JC thanks Stuart for all his hard work over the last couple of years. The
 consensus on the Council list was that since SY's term was up at the end of the
 year, it's not worth looking for a short\-term replacement. KH would like to see
 the Board clarify this in the bylaws, so that there would be a clear path
 forward in this kind of situation in future. LB suggests that JC propose to the
 Board that if only three months or less is left before an election, someone
 leaving should not be replaced. JC will suggest to the Board that they clarify
 this.




 TEI Lite (LB) 
 
 LB has done a lot of changes and updates to TEI Lite. He still needs to clarify
 with SR and others regarding testing etc.; if it remains part of the build
 process, it will need to be tested during building, but if it's “archived” in
 the sense of being moved to the Vault, this would be unnecessary. MH suggests it
 should be formally removed from the release package after the next release, but
 LB thinks this is a bad idea, and will not win us friends. KH points out that if
 the @source attribute is added to the schemaSpec element, the build process
 would always use a previous version of TEI to build it, and therefore it
 wouldn't need updating. JC reminded Council that it might still build
 differently if we were to make changes in the stylesheets or the build process.
 MH noted likewise that if the ODD specification and ODD processing changes, this
 will break Lite. LB suggested an example of the sort of thing we want to stop
 doing is this: we have just added into Lite some completely new features, such
 as the use of @facs. We should not be doing that, but we should be continuing to
 build it and make sure that it works. KH asked Could we add something into the
 build process that pulls an archived version from the Vault and adds it into the
 release package? JC thought that it shouldn't be a problem to do this and doing
 the same for the Oxygen framework. JC thinks it should still be made available
 in the way it currently is, even if behind the scenes (via an Apache rewrite or
 symlink, like the Guidelines as a whole) it comes from the Vault. LB noted that
 apart from that, changes are good and the result is useful, so the
 archiving/maintenance issue is the only remaining one. 


Once this work on Lite is finished, a similar process will be applied to Tite.


Actions: MH will summarize the options to the Council list, as a
 way of kick\-starting the discussion of archiving etc.




 Reminder to finish off Ann Arbor Actions (JC)
 
 
 Go to the wiki page of actions from Ann Arbor, and for anything that's assigned
 to you and not done, do it. Be told. Do as JC says, and not as he apparently
 does. Let's clear this list ahead of the face\-to\-face meeting if we can. 


 MH suggested that any items which are still outstanding which are not tickets
 should be turned into tickets by their assignees, and assigned to themselves. LB
 noted that re: multimedia, nobody has done anything on this yet, but in the
 meantime, LR and some German people have got together on an ISO activity to
 harmonize some existing standards, which they would like to standardize in the
 form of an ODD file. They are looking at the existing standards for
 transcription of speech and video. There is an article in jTEI by Thomas Schmidt
 which addresses this issue very well (<http://jtei.revues.org/142>). 
 If that workgroup does what it proposes,
 then we will have one answer to this ticket. LR has asked if someone from
 Council could attend their meetings, and LB is willing to attend as
 representative. Everyone agrees this would be a good idea. 


JC notes that we have done very well in keeping expenses down, and if we can
 continue to do that, we might be able to fund a code bounty potentially for a
 rewrite of the Roma interface. JC thanks Lou for being a good bloke and
 attending the workgroup meeting in November




 New Business Arising
 
 
  None was raised by Council. JC thanked everyone for attending.
