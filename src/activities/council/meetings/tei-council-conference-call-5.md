 AC, CT, DO, TM, LR, JW, DB, DP, and a mysterious tennis
 player.


MD sends apologies; JC had sent his apologies earlier.


SB is taking notes.





 Minutes from last meeting
 SB: summarize issues surrounding dating attributes …* SB reports this action was finally completed last night

 post 
 date attributes: summary, problems, and
 some suggestions](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2007/002164.html)2006\-02\-06
LB: statement of 'limited phrase'
 problem …* SB reminded Council that this had been determined to
 be a false action immediately after the last call. LB
 reminded Council that SB had proposed two possible paths forward
 in [post
 
 oops; I mis\-led y'all on 'limited
 phrase' task of](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2006/001986.html)  labeled
 A and B; SR, CW, and CT all voted for
 B, and no one objected. 
 SB
 implement limited phrase
 
 2007\-02\-14
all: read \& comment on JW's [revised document](http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~jawalsh/tei/biblItem.html)* JW's document recommends that 
 biblItem be
 replaced with a different mechanism (
 relatedItem)
 for encoding the relationship of one bibliographic item to
 another. While no one objected in principle, both SB \&
 LR requested more time to discuss the proposal to ensure
 that the capabilities of the current 
 biblItem are
 retained.
 
 LR \& LB
 discuss 
 relatedItem on the Council list
 \[?...?] is this due date for discussion or implementation \[?...?]
 
 2007\-02\-13
DO: inform MD how much money is available to Council* DO reported his findings, explaining that the Board
 had voted to roll Council's unspent funds from last year
 over to this year; DO noted that this is not an automatic
 rollover — the Board votes each year what to do whit
 surplusses. Council agreed to spend its rollover on the
 second 
 personagrphay meeting MD will
 be organizing.
DP \& CT: post revised text \& image encoding
 document …* A draft was posted on 
 : [facsimile 
 markup](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2006/001993.html)
DP \& CT: make ODD of it* CT reports he is almost done coding an ODD; he has run
 into a hitch redefining classes, hopes to have it
 straightened out soon, but may need the help of an ODD
 expert. This ODD is based on the ideas put forth in the
 [facsimile 
 markup](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2006/001993.html) post mentioned above. There was
 general agreement that if new TEI elements are introduced
 they should probably go into chapter
 FT\-TablesFormulaeGraphics.
 
 CT (\& DP)

 deferred, and the item is carried forward:
 MD
 Rewrite the examples MM provides in the PB
 document using a more generic mechanism
 
 2007\-03\-04
LB: ponder and post discussion of multilingual example
 problem …* LB posted a few days ago that he does not think this
 will require changes to ODD, just a procedures
 document.

CW
 look for problems in current system; report
 findings to Council
 
 2007\-02\-14
JC: summarize discussion of conformance and write a proposal* Discussion postponed as JC not present.
eds.: update \[SF feature request] doc …* This was not discussed on the call; however, it was
 subsequently pointed out that it will come up prominently in
 the road\-map being developed.
all: let list know if you expect to be available for a meeting in Berlin* everyone had done so.
SR: report on high speed conferences .com
 system* This was not reported on directly, but since this
 meeting was using the system, we can draw the conclusion
 that SR has reported back on this as being worth a trial.





 PB
 
 Council reluctantly concluded that, realistically, it will
 probably be necessary to defer inclusion of a detailed
 discussion of physical bibliography to a future
 sub\-release of P5 (e.g., to P5 1\.1\).




 PERS
 
 It was reported that MD is organizing a two\-headed
 meeting in Vilnius in late February, consisting of a 2\-day
 discussion on place name issues and any other outstanding
 personography hosted by the Institute for Lithuanian
 Language of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, and a
 1\-day TEI outreach event at and co\-hosted by Vilnius
 University.




 I18N
 
 As sufficient funds were available, SR has added Italian
 to the list of languages being worked on. By the summer we
 will need to think about how this stuff will be made
 available in the P5 release, i.e. what the user interface
 and the look\-and\-feel will be in the online Guidelines. 





 Road to P5
 
 The discussion revolved around the possible use of
 task\-tracking software and the need for a 
 prodding
 czar to remind people of ongoing tasks to help keep
 us on schedule. It was pointed out that project management or
 task\-tracking software is really just a tool in the prodding
 czar's arsenal. LB suggested that the main problem is a lack of
 resources, not lack of planning. Other said that more
 structured planning can make better use of scarce
 resources. CW suggested TCW08, EDW81 and a couple of other
 lists should be placed on a Wiki. After a lengthy discussion,
 it was decided to create a planning subcommittee, initially
 consisting of DO, CW, and SR. Their first action is to create
 a list of things which had to be achieved to reach P5 by a
 notional date of October 1st, along with their necessary dates
 of completion. When agreed, the same group would be tasked to
 ensure the tasks were implemented. The list should use previous efforts \&
 lists as a starting point.
