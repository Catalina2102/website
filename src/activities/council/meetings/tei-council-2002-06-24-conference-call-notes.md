Call commenced at \~ 12:01\-00 with GR, SB, FJ, PW, MP, LB,
 SR, JU, DB; MD joined a bit later; CW \&amp; TE never joined
 (nor did DD nor LR, but that was expected).


CW \&amp; TE, it turns out, were the victims of mistaken
 timezone.




 committee reports
 
 
 Training
 
 GR explained the training committee had written 1 general
 and 2 specific (for Chicago 2002\-10, and for GA 2003\) RFPs
 for training courses. Suggested that within a few weeks all
 3 would be edited \&amp; posted. SB said the programme
 committee for the Oct member's meeting would like that
 specific RFP out ASAP, preferably shortly after MMs return. GR
 thinks that's reasonable (he will be talking to MM on phone
 circa 06\-28\).


Thanks to the training committee for this work.


Lou recommends that the three RFPs be combined into one;
 general agreement, there should be one RFP, with an
 appendix that gives particulars for upcoming events that
 require specific proposals.
 
 GR
 Inform training committee of recommendation from
 Council to combine RFPs
 
training committee
 Combine RFPs into one general with reference to
 the two specific events, perhaps as an
 appendix.
 
In retrospect, I am not yet 100% convinced
 of the wisdom of this, and plan to send the council
 thoughts on the matter if I am still unconvinced after
 discussing w/ GR. \-\- Syd



GR notes that, esp. for proposals for training at the Oct
 member's meeting, they do not have to be full\-blown
 proposals. SB points out that programme committee is
 expecting a 1\-day training on Thu 2002\-10\-10\.


Although questions about an RFP may (or should) be sent to
 the training committee, and questions about the venue, etc.,
 may (or should) be sent to the local organizer, the
 Proposals themselves should be sent to JU, who will forward
 them to the Council for \[dis]approval.


Motion that amended (as discussed) RFPs be accepted; passed.



LB, SR1 July 2002
 send a response to the general RFP for their 15 Jul
 course
 





 certification
 
 Software certification discussion: we're leaning towards
 encouraging reviews of software (cull form TEI\-L?)
 (certify reviewers? certify reviews?)
 
 MD, SB to proof if MD wants
 write a draft certification policy
 
SR, LB
 
 cull the list for reviews to put on website
 
LB \&amp; SR \&mdash; if you like, let me
 know when you're ready to roll, and I'll send you an
 archive of the list. \-\- SB
 So we are shifting from certification to reviews.





 P5
 
 
 core tags and schema
 
 Discussion of SR's proposal 
 
notes for
 conference call on 24th
2002\-06\-24
 00:25\+01
\-\- SB thinks timescale
 aggresive, but SR \&amp; JU think it's reasonable (better
 to have too aggresive a deadline than none at all).


SB agrees strongly that TSD become an additional tagset,
 and that P5 be written in (possibly extended) TSD.


SR suggests Son of Odd report for members meeting
 2002\-10; SB suggests \[dis]approval by Council in 2003\-01;
 SR recommends including discussions of manuscript, char
 sets, standoff to that 2003\-01 council meeting; MP reports
 manuscript should be ready.


Within the discussion there was concensus that it's
 important to change from DTD notation to some other
 notation inside \&lt;elemDecl\>s (whether a pre\-existing
 schema or our own is still an open question), and to allow
 multiple schema output from odds (i.e., to give TEI users
 choice in which schema language they use to validate their
 TEI documents).


Motion to accept SR's timetable as a framework approved.



SR
 talk to PR or SB about getting a timeslot to
 report on Son of Odd at 2002\-10 member's meeting in
 Chicago, perhaps as part of editor's report.
  SB reports that he thinks the preliminary plan
 already has 20 mins for editors and a separate 20 mins for
 SR.




 character encoding WG update
 
 LB reports on char sets WG progress \-\- lots of discussion
 via e\-mail, mostly centered on how much of the world's
 problems Unicode solves. Face\-to\-face WG meeting planned
 for 2002\-07\-23/24 in T\&uuml;bingen (in conjunction with
 ALLC/ACH 2002\). Both SB \&amp; plan to be present. WG is
 working on detailed proposals for a replacement to WSD
 mechanism which LB (\&amp; SB) expect will be discussed at
 WG meeting in T\&uuml;bingen. CW doing good job keeping it
 going w/o domination by a particular person or
 constituency.


Council agreed that requirement for 1\.5 days of meeting
 in order to obtain TEI reimbursement be waved, if needed,
 for this WG meeting. It was suggested that council need
 not vote, that chair could just do this
 unilaterally.
 JU
 Notify CW of relaxed restriction of 1\.5 days for
 character sets WG meeting in T\&uuml;bingen
 2002\-07\.
 
Since the council had agreed, I didn't take
 up valuable phone time saying this, but I think it is
 important that no single individual have the power to
 unilaterally make exceptions to or grant exemptions from
 promulgated rules or procedures like those in ED W 54\. I
 think that such decisions need to be reserved for the
 council or board, or for a pre\-defined group of officers
 (chair and both editors; chair, executive director, one
 editor; chair, executive director, one host representive
 \&mdash; idunno)





 stand\-off markup, xlink, xpointer WG
 
 SB reported on WG progress by briefly reading some
 sections of DD's mail to group
 
 
2002\-06\-19T16:31\-04,
startup
: 
 
 \&hellip; it's past time for us to start up.
 \&hellip; trying to get John Garofolo of NIST to join the
 group; if he does not, I will entertain suggestions of
 corpus linguists who might join the group. \&hellip; an
 email list, supplemented by a regular conference call
 \&hellip; initial suggestion that the call be on
 alternate Wednesdays, starting on 2002\-06\-26, at
 13:00\-00\. \&hellip; attached the preliminary
 
 charge \&hellip; Preliminary agenda:
 
 * introductions
* proceedures: \&hellip;
* time limit: \&hellip;
* reactions to charge: \&hellip;






Council wanted assurance that an editor would be
 available for each call; SB \&amp; LB do not think this
 will be a problem.


Someone voiced concern as to whether or not council
 should be worried about lack of progress \&mdash;
 \[preliminary or draft? \-\- SB] report is due \[2002\-08\-01 or
 2002\-10\-11? \-\- SB]. SB said no need to worry yet, but
 should recheck after \[2 or 3] of the planned conference
 calls (and then become concerned if little or no
 progress).
 
 SB or LB (whichever one makes conference call)
 keep council posted on WG progress
 





 medieval MSS description
 
 While MP may not be at member's meeting (snif! What's
 wrong with a TEI meeting as a honeymoon? Well,
 congratulations in any case), she is still hopeful that
 she and MD can get together this summer to hammer out
 differences in manuscript description stuff.




 next meeting, assignments, future business
 
 Future meetings: We like conference calls; SB suggests
 one roughly every 3 months.
 
 JU
 schedule future council conference calls
  Perry is willing to continue hosting them. (And
 subsequently agreed to post notices in UTC, preferably in
 an unambiguous format).


SR points out we need to have firm deadlines before
 2003\-01 face\-to\-face, as it's expensive.
