 Thaller.





 Scope of Council Activities
 
 
 
 Technical Activities
 
 
 
 
 Guideline Status
 
 
 LR asks us to consider the current status of Guidelines. How are we handling
 updates and point releases? SR reminds us that he had raised the question of
 fixed release vs. varying bug\-fix releases and had recommended a 2x per year
 schedule. GB, AC, and SB agreed that practice and consensus was for a fixed
 timetable. SR notes that the 1\.0\.1 release is a "release zero", not a 6\-month
 release. LR concurs: the next release will be over the summer, unless serious
 bugs appear. JC notes that everyone has access to 
 [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tei/) for intermediate
 stages.


Should we have a "stable/unstable" distinction? It's helpful for people to test
 releases. LB: there is a fixed date in the TEI timetable, the November meeting.
 Shall we say there will always be a prerelease of next major release before
 Nov?


JC asks about numbering of releases, so people can cite the version of
 the Guidelines they are using. SR: the only way to do this is by release dates,
 where the date is the version number. LR notes that a release is more than just
 a source version on SourceForge, it involves a lot of checking. DO asks if
 someone could just write up a numbering system for us to put on a Web page? A
 new version number will be added when there is an actual feature/module change,
 not just changes to Guidelines language.


LR: can we stabilize the following formulation? 
 
Releases every 6 months; a
 prerelease before the November meeting; unstable SourceForge branches are
 maintained and identified by SourceForge revision number. A "release"
 consists of the SourceForge update, creation of compiled packages and
 schemas, and an update of the Guidelines (LB).






 
 Bug reporting
 
 
 LR asks about the current situation with the stability of the Guidelines: do we
 still have major bugs, or just tiny issues over next months? JC: it's not clear
 where bug reports are going any more. LB: it is clear we want bug reports to go
 to SourceForge, into the tracker. But we haven't agreed on: (1\) how to make
 sure Council provides input, or who is responsible; (2\) the way to build a
 workflow to take suggestions \& deal with them. DO: this will be an
 important thing to discuss in Galway. LB: is this channel best way of
 soliciting input? SB: no, many people are scared by SourceForge. We need to
 have an email/list mechanism. LB: then at the point in discussion where there
 is general agreement, someone needs to write it up as a SourceForge feature
 request. LR notes the gap between TEI\-L and TEI Council. DO: So we need
 formally to keep an eye on TEI\-L, and put into SourceForge bug reports and
 feature requests from there. JC: shouldn't all Council members do this? DO: but
 it helps to have someone designated. LR agrees; at the Members' Meeting, we
 discussed the dropping of Guideline 
 editors, with work on them organized by
 Council, but LR strongly recommends that we provide stable editorial support to
 Oxford. DO: the decision about editors was made to
 increase flexibility, not to remove input from the current editors. There is no
 mandate for "editors" in the (TEI Consortium) Bylaws, but we can still assign
 certain tasks as needed.


 LR recommends that Board discuss this matter; we need an 
 air traffic
 controller.


There followed some additional discussion on bug reporting/tracking procedures.
 DS suggests the possibility of a Wiki area on the TEI Wiki for bug discussion.
 SB suggests having a single email address for bug reports. DO objects that this
 creates multiple unofficial channels for bug reports. We don't want multiple
 lists. SB replies that we're going to have this no matter what. LB replies we
 can insist on paying attention only to two places and having bug reports sent to
 specified venues. JC says that if bugs are to be discussed on an email list,
 surely that should be TEI\-L. AC notes some people don't understand the
 distinctions between the different venues. We need a mechanism to facilitate
 communication for less technically adept users. DO asks, why not have a
 volunteer from Council as facilitator?


LR: there's a problem with having too many tools. Let's have a clear mechanism.
 TEI\-L is a good place for all these discussions; let us not have lots of side
 discussions.


DO: Okay, let's use SourceForge as our single location, with mechanisms for
 helping people report who don't use SourceForge. LR: there should be tutorials
 on how to report. If we reduce number of tools, people can be more aware of
 them.


DO: it sounds like we have identified a need for a release secretary and a
 SourceForge secretary, and an editorial support group.





 
 Outreach and Education
 
 
 
 
 ODD
 
 
 LR begins by suggesting that 
 exemplars and
 
 ODD are key words. One of main
 ways we can offer entry into the TEI environment is by adding ready\-made
 schemas. SR cautions that if we create exemplars by committee, it will be
 difficult to get results. SB says that the current crop of exemplars are good
 for creating ODDs, but not so good for tackling various tasks. We don't have
 sample schemas that are good for encoding. For example: we don't show how to
 use constraints. SR observes that an exemplar constraining types might not be
 useful for individual needs. TEI Tite and TEI Lite, on the other hand, are
 intended to "be used"; LB concurs that whatever the original intentions behind
 Lite were, it is used as an "off the shelf" product. GB: we don't want example
 ODDs, we want example projects. \[Unidentified] notes that the word
 
 exemplar is
 ambiguous, especially for non\-English speakers; can we find a better term?
 \[Note from DS: this is correct, for English speakers as well. The 


New
 Oxford Dictionary of English definition of 
 exemplar
 is "a person or thing
 serving as a typical example or appropriate model". The latter sense is
 normative; the former is not.]
 
 
 
 LB: this is what the TEI by Example project was supposed to provide.
 Unfortunately it's not doing that. It would be good to have set of examples of
 how people have solved things. JC agrees: "case studies". \[Unidentified] says
 this is an issue of the scope of Council: instead of doing this ourselves, we
 should figure out how to liaise w/ other groups doing these activities. General
 agreement.


LR asks, what is status of ODD? Should we focus on improvements to ODD
 features? SB: yes, but we should defer this so we can address other issues
 first. SR agrees; this isn't a core business of Council in 2008; we should
 treat it as a parallel activity. LR objects that this ODD is in fact essential
 to outreach, as many TEI communities can contribute via ODD modules. The
 importance of ODD means it should be on our agenda (even if we don't make
 changes). GB concurs that it may be a mistake to segregate ODD activity;
 customizing TEI is a basic activity. Any outreach/education will connect with
 ODD.


SR: We don't want to send the message "here's the language to use, but we're
 going to change it". ODD is unusual because it is tied up with the software
 that implements it.




 
 Other Outreach and Internationalization Goals
 
 
 LR: Within Council, we should find a way to relate to external projects
 connected with TEI. We will integrate results of other groups; some of us will
 have duties to interact with specific ones. "I see more and more requests for
 short introductions on specific topics and offering examples." We could provide
 consultation on these matters. DO agrees: this has always been Council's duty.
 For example, current funding proposals before the National Endowment for the
 Humanities include two very TEI\-centric projects.


LR: This is true of internationalization also.


Question: how do we identify the groups with which Council should interact? LR
 suggests this is part of Council's activity. DO asks whether we should issue
 invitations for groups who want Council involvement. JC notes that when someone
 comes to TEI\-L an asks "can someone help me?" we need to provide a name. DO
 says this will become more and more important in funding projects.


LR concludes: we should systematize the responsibility of these "corresponding
 persons". This will be added to the Galway meeting agenda.






 
 Global Organization of Council
 
 
 
 
 Communication
 
 
 The next discussion involved the TEI's communication platforms, specifically the
 TEI website and our mailing lists. LR notes a need for Council workgroups or
 people to oversee both. The Board has appointed a website workgroup that we can
 provide input to.


LB notes that service over the past year from Council email list has not been
 good; the server has been down too often. JC asks whether it wouldn't make sense
 to have all TEI email lists hosted on tei\-c.org? SB raises a difficulty: the main
 list TEI\-L is run on commercial software. No alternative software that he is aware
 of supports that level of service. Can we find open\-source software? LB says that
 TEI\-L is working fine and is not the issue. But perhaps the tei\-council list
 should be moved. Level of service is more important than whether or not all the
 lists are in one place.


LR summarizes that we need to confirm ongoing support for the lists at Virginia,
 or explore the possibility of merging or moving list hosts. DS offers to confer
 with his Virginia colleagues on that status of the system hosting the lists. \[He
 reported back that lists.village.virginia.edu, the host for the TEI Council and
 Board email lists, is indeed in the process of being merged with the new tei\-c.org
 host, which will have 24/7 tech support; and the IATH system administrator is
 looking into adding full\-text search on the tei\-council list archive.]




 
 Responsibilities
 
 
 LR moves on to a discussion of general TEI Consortium responsibilities and
 Council's part in them. DO raises the issue of who "has the keys" to different
 things: who has responsibility, for example, for the SourceForge repository, for
 www.tei\-c.org., etc? Should we survey who controls the different things we use?
 LR: Yes. if we know for example that U of Virgina has responsibility for the
 website, we need to have a single contact person. Likewise with Oxford's editorial
 support. DO: we don't have a single list of responsibilities. We should maybe put
 together before Galway meeting: SourceForge, mailing lists, website, Wiki... who
 has the passwords and oversight. SB agrees that such an inventory is important. LR
 asks that all "keyholders" please send a note to DS for inclusion in the minutes.

 Preparation for Galway Meeting
 
 
 LR: Dates for the meeting are fixed, April 2\-4\. Organizer and contact person is Malte
 
 Rehbein (malte.rehbein@nuigalway.ie). On Wednesday the 2nd there will be a symposium
 
 organized by Malte, who has issued a Call for Papers. The Council meeting proper will
 
 take place on the 3rd and 4th. We don't have a specific plan for Council members to
 
 participate in the symposium, but it is expected that we will attend and contribute.
 
 AC says that the organizers are focusing on presentations from the Irish TEI
 
 community. They will see how many local presentations they have and will then ask
 
 Council if they need supplementation. LR notes that we have a group hotel rate, so
 no
 
 need to worry about lodging. We'll plan to start the Council meeting early on
 
 Thursday, and to end by 4 p.m. Friday afternoon. DO will post to tei\-council about
 
 arrangements.


Information about Council funding of the meeting is on the TEI Wiki in the [TEI Council FAQ](/wiki/index.php/TEI-Council-FAQ#What_funding_is_available_for_Council_Activities.3F).
