### Agenda / Notes



* Release 3\.2\.0
	+ - SB \& SS are the release technicians
			* + [IRC Information](https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/IRC "IRC Information")
		- Possible issue with IRC—may not be available through your institution/ may need a
		 web client.
		- Should we switch to Slack? We could record history here (have to set a preference
		 in order to record IRC history)
		- HC Suggests Slack since that is cool and shiny.
* Timeline:
	+ Refrigeration starts: Mon 06\-26 (typos, prose changes, small issues)
	+ Freeze starts: Mon 07\-03
	+ Release day: Mon 07\-10
* + TEIC/TEI [Milestone Issues](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/milestones/Guidelines%203.2.0 "Milestone Issues")
		- [1552](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1552 "1552"): MS encouraged to make green an implement
		- [1651](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1651 "1651"): JC notes that this one is done, just leaving open for related Stylesheets change
		 that should be done as well. Council recommends closing, so he does.
		- [379](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/379 "379"): EB notes that this one needs some careful writing; think we can do it for this release,
		 want help. EM will draft wording for review.
		- PS wants to finish [1441](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1441 "1441"). Almost done …
	+ Release different outputs of exemplars
* Other business?
	+ EM discusses some of the problems w/ managing TEI\-L
		- bots asking permission to join is very common
		- When we get a spam post (usually of the nature of “come read my blog”), it causes
		 a small flurry of unsubscribes. These are probably list members who aren’t very involved
		 anyway.
		- So far EM doesn’t see a real problem in handling subscribe request
		- Please notify EM or SB quickly if you notice spam on any of the TEI lists.
	+ JC Notes quick ticket solving: [https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1660](https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1660 "https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1660")Just over 30 minutes ;\-)
