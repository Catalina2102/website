# TEI Council Meeting





All times are local (Irish Summer Time, UTC \+1\) unless otherwise
 noted.


In attendance, from TEI Council: Laurent Romary (LR; chair),
 Gabriel Bodard (GB), Peter Boot (PB), Tone Merete Bruvik (TB),
 Arianna Ciula (AC), James Cummings (JC), Daniel O'Donnell (DO;
 Board Chair), Elena Pierazzo (EP), Paul Schaffner (PS), David
 Sewell (DS; minutes), and John Walsh (JW). Representing Oxford
 editorial support group: Lou Burnard (LB) and Sebastian Rahtz
 (SR). Not present: Manfred Thaller.


The meetings were held at the [Moore
 Institute for Research in the Humanities and Social
 Studies](http://www.nuigalway.ie/mooreinstitute/) at the National University of Ireland, Galway. Most
 Council members were also present for the 


Symposium on
 Text Encoding in the Humanities held at the Moore
 Institute on April 2, the day prior to the Council meeting, and
 several contributed presentations. The TEI Council wish to thank
 NUIG for hosting us, arranging lodging, and graciously inviting
 us to share a superb dinner with them.
 
 The meeting was called to order on Thursday at approximately
 09:30 and continued until approximately 17:30; it resumed on Friday at approximately
 09:30 and continued until approximately 16:45.





 Introductions and Procedural Issues
 
 Council members briefly introduced themselves and their key
 projects or interests. 


Minutes from the Council [telephone meeting of 7 February 2008](/Activities/Council/Meetings/tcm37.xml) were approved. DO
 noted that the TEI Board has approved the proposal made during
 that meeting that an editorial support group at U of Oxford be
 formally established, for an initial trial period of two years
 (see next agenda item).




 Council Work and Organization
 
 
 Editorial support
 
 SR outlined the major tasks of the editorial support group in
 Oxford and the nature of its relationship to Council:


* Monitor TEI\-L and email to [editors@tei\-c.org](mailto:editors@tei-c.org) in order to identify feature
 requests and bug reports for the Guidelines. Triage these
 and present them to Council for decisions where necessary.
* Silently handle minor fixes and corrections, and prepare
 Guidelines releases every 6 months.
* Maintain the tools that are considered to be TEI
 Consortium deliverables, such as the XSLT stylesheets and
 Roma. (There are other tools for which it is less clear
 whether they are to be seen as TEI\-endorsed.)


In summary, the main job of the editorial support group is to
 be sure that TEI deliverables are maintained.


LR notes that this represents a real change. Editors are no
 longer taking decisions unilaterally, but rather based on
 exchanges with Council. He suggests regular reports to Council
 from the support group. (Discussion: is anything needed beyond
 the changelogs kept automatically on SourceForge? Consensus:
 periodic summaries of significant changes would be useful in
 addition.) 
 LB will produce
 a summary of all SourceForge changes a week before every
 Council meeting.



This agenda item concluded with some discussion of how the
 Oxford group would insure redundancy and continuity. SR noted
 that the editorial tasks can be handled by any one of SR, LB,
 and JC. As for interaction with Council and representation at
 Council meetings, consensus was that ordinarily one
 representative from the Oxford group will attend meetings as a
 non\-elected member, but Council may invite more at its
 discretion.




 Role of SIGs and working groups
 
 Discussion of this agenda item covered four main topics: (1\)
 the nature of the continuum between Special Interest Groups
 (SIGs) and chartered TEI workgroups; (2\) the relation of SIGs
 and workgroups to Council; (3\) procedures for insuring SIGs
 remain viable, and discontinuing moribund SIGs when necessary;
 and (4\) strategies for encouraging a wide range of activity.
 DO notes that the Board (??) is interested in breaking down
 the fixed distinction between SIGs and workgroups in the
 interest of flexibility in meeting needs. 


1\. The main difference between a SIG and a workgroup is that
 the latter is formed to complete a particular task (with
 defined deliverables) and is chartered until the completion of
 that task. LB notes that it has always been the case that if a
 formal task proposal emerges from a SIG, Council may charter a
 workgroup. DO notes that certain small tasks may be assigned
 to a SIG without requiring a formal charter. Asked whether TEI
 has a budget to encourage such small targeted tasks, DO
 replied that although the budget needs to be formalized there
 would seem to be some funds available. 
 DO
 report back on funding situation for 
 small SIG
 tasks.



2\. Previously, when a workgroup was chartered its chair became
 a non\-elected member of Council (??). Going forward,
 individual Council members will serve as mentors/liaisons to
 both workgroups and SIGs. The head of a workgroup may still be
 invited to Council meetings as needed. In summary: Council
 will formally charter workgroups and specific SIG tasks, and
 assign a Council liaison in each case. We also have a formal
 SIG coordinator appointed from the Board (currently Susan
 Schreibman).


3\. Workgroups have a specific charter, but SIGs are centered
 around a mission statement representing shared interest. Thus
 there is the problem that a SIG may become moribund. How do we
 get rid of deadwood (LR)? The Board has the
 authority to disband them, but we should focus on support: SIG
 leaders will now have a term of office, assuring turnover.
 Council will assist the SIG coordinator in encouraging the
 activities of SIGs. LR notes that one of Council's roles is to
 insure that SIGs and workgroups have complementary,
 non\-overlapping roles. EP says that the required SIG reports
 are another important way for Council to keep track of SIG
 activity.


4\. We agree that it is in the TEI's interest to encourage a
 wide range of activities, from formally chartered workgroups
 through SIGs to more loosely affiliated interest groups. An
 advantage of TEI 
 branding of activities
 is that we give credit to people who contribute to the
 community (DO). SIGs will not always center around a specific
 shared task; as JC notes, some SIGs exist mainly for community
 building rather than to provide deliverables. 


We concluded with some discussion of TEI\-related activity that
 is not formally affiliated with the TEI Consortium. DO
 suggested that we need to do more to capture contributions
 from the community at large, but it was noted that some
 projects, e.g. [TEI by Example](http://www.kantl.be/ctb/project/2006/tei-ex.htm), want to be autonomous. We agreed
 that our outreach doesn't have to be
 
 colonial.





 Technical Discussions
 
 
 Procedures for handling Guidelines feature requests and
 bugs
 
 LR summarizes our basic procedures:
 
 everyday bugs (fixing typos and small
 technical errors) will be handled by the Oxford editorial
 support group. The Oxford group will also gather feature
 requests and bug reports from TEI\-L, email, and elsewhere.
 These will be presented to Council for consideration on a
 regular basis.


JC and SR agree that Council members should be encouraged to
 submit feature requests and bug reports as well. There are
 some concerns about the ease of use of the Sourceforge
 tracking system and the fact that (as SR pointed out) there is
 not full overlap between the group of people who can assign
 and close SourceForge tasks and the group of developers with
 write\-access to the Subversion repository. Should we split up
 the SourceForge projects? After discussion, consensus was that
 the SourceForge system has worked without serious problems and
 should not be subject to major changes at this time.




 Outstanding Sourceforge feature requests and bugs
 
 A major portion of our time on Day 1 was spent discussing
 outstanding [bugs](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=644062&group_id=106328&func=browse) and [feature requests](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=644065&group_id=106328&func=browse) on SourceForge. The items and
 outcomes are summarized in a separate document, [Council Tracker Review: 3 April
 08](/Activities/Council/Working/tcw12.xml), which is hereby included by reference in
 these minutes.




 New chapter proposal on rendering
 
 We next considered the [proposal from Brett Zamir](/Activities/Council/Working/tcw10.xml) to add to the Guidelines a
 chapter 


Recommendations on the
 formatting of TEI documents.
 
 After some discussion, Council reached a consensus that the
 draft document is not suitable as a formal chapter of the
 Guidelines, largely because the technologies and procedures
 used for output rendering change frequently and are not under
 the control of the TEI Consortium (e.g., XSLT processors, CSS
 standards, etc.). However, we agreed that users of the TEI,
 particularly new users, are typically interested in questions
 of output: I have tagged it, now how do I show it?
 Therefore we should make a point of incorporating some of the
 suggestions from the draft chapter in other material, such as
 the proposed 


Getting Started with TEI document
 (q.v. below).
 

 TEI\-METS
 
 \[JW was originally scheduled to report on the status of TEI
 and [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/), but we deemed that this ground had been covered
 sufficiently by the [paper](http://www.slis.indiana.edu/news/story.php?story_id=1709) that he had presented at the Wednesday
 workshop.]




Getting Started with TEI document proposal
 
 Peter Boot had previously suggested that Council discuss the
 creation of an introductory document on using the TEI
 Guidelines, sponsored by the TEI and produced as an activity
 led by Council. PB had volunteered to chair this activity.


In PB's view, this document would be a 
 lowest common
 denominator, assuming as a typical reader
 perhaps a graduate student working on a text who wants to make
 it available using TEI. It would not re\-do our 


Gentle
 Introduction to XML but would be a new document
 conceived as a standalone resource that could be read by
 itself as a complete text, something one could “read on the
 train”, although it would contain many pointers (and links, in
 its Web\-based version) to other material. It would be clearly
 visible as a central TEI document and should in LR's words be
 a 
 flagship entry point to the TEI. As an
 analogue, Edward Vanhoutte's 
 An
 Introduction to the TEI and the TEI Consortium in
 
 Literary and Linguistic Computing ([19\.1, 2004\)](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/9) has been cited as one of
 LLC's most frequently downloaded articles.
 
 Consensus: all agreed that we want to move forward
 with this project. In DO's words, this is as central a task
 for Council as Guidelines. A book not of similar
 complexity, but of similar deliberation.
 
 Some further discussion focused on issues of content and
 audience. PB's original proposal had suggested targeting
 examples at Windows users, but Council consensus was that an
 official TEI document cannot be platform\-specific. LB notes
 that when introductory TEI documents were first proposed, the
 assumption was that a primer works best when addressed to
 members of a specific discipline; he advocates careful thought
 about the scope of this publication and its target audience.
 Consensus emerged around LR's observation that the document
 should have sufficient material to be suitable for students as
 well as specialist researchers. DS suggested we might survey
 potential readers ahead of time on topics they'd like to see
 addressed; DO recommended that we circulate a first draft
 online for feedback.


We agreed with LB that this document must look different from
 existing introductory guides and tutorials;
 
 simplicity should be a key goal, with short,
 precise sections and word limits. (LR suggests a maximum
 length equivalent to about 50 printed pages.)


PB will go ahead and take charge of this
 project with assistance from Council, coming up with a list of
 contributors (after we issue a call for volunteers) and
 returning with a fuller proposal based on response. We will
 aim for a first draft suitable for feedback for the
 
 Members' Meeting in November 2008.


 Proposal for SIG on correspondence
 
 LR and DS presented the [proposal for a Special Interest Group on correspondence](https://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/Working/tcw13.pdf) that came to use from Peter Stadler and
 Joachim Veit of Paderborn University. DS noted that previously
 two major initiatives have developed TEI extensions designed
 to handle epistolary documents and related genres, the [Model Editions
 Partnership](http://adh.sc.edu/) and [DALF](/Activities/Projects/da03.xml); he advised that any new efforts toward TEI
 customizations for use with correspondence should look closely
 at the document analyses and solutions devised by those
 groups. (DS noted that in the American context on which the
 MEP concentrated, correspondence was one of a number of genres
 included in 
 documentary editions (e.g.
 the 


Papers of George Washington), and had
 originally proposed that the SIG's mission might include this
 larger context; but Council consensus was that the specific
 focus on correspondence/epistles is an appropriate scope.) 
 
 LR stated that the SIG proposers should address four points:
 (1\) the scope of the SIG (just personal correspondence or
 
 epistles, or more?); (2\) examples of encoded
 material; (3\) networking the various groups and initiatives
 interested in correspondence, beyond the context of
 German\-speaking musical historians; (4\) the object of the SIG
 as a TEI\-chartered group.


Council agreed that the purpose of this SIG should not be the
 creation of a Guidelines chapter; rather, a document on
 encoding certain types of documents (perhaps included proposed
 TEI customizations). If this work is done well enough, we can
 
 brand it. In any event, Council and
 the SIG liaison assigned to the group should monitor their
 work closely. 
 DS will
 submit an outline to the Paderborn researchers expressing
 our interest in the proposal and asking them to address
 LR's four points.






 Tools
 
 
 OpenOffice and Microsoft Word conversions
 
 This agenda item was to address the tools provided on
 Sourceforge for [converting between TEI\-XML and OpenOffice](/wiki/index.php/TEI_OpenOffice_Package), and
 related MS Word conversion. SR began by noting that although
 the OpenOffice stylesheets are hosted on the TEI Sourceforge
 site, there has never been a suggestion that they are an
 official TEI activity; they are an individual contribution
 from SR. Nor is he actively developing Word stylesheets
 (though this will change if the ISO project goes forward).
 There are really two purposes for conversion to and from word
 processing formats: its an easy way to write angle
 brackets, and an easier way to print documents than using
 TEI\-XML (usually). Consensus was that the TEI does not want to
 
 own these tools for now, as that
 imposes a requirement to maintain them. 




 Work on TEI (X)HTML and PDF stylesheets
 
 A related item is the [XSLT
 stylesheets](/Tools/Stylesheets/) which we do formally provide as a tool
 for transforming TEI documents to HTML, LaTeX, and XSL\-FO.
 Discussion here focused on how these might be improved and/or
 extended.


As a preliminary caveat, however, SR noted that we don't
 want to imply there's a default way of rendering
 everything. JW observed that we already have a problem
 with TEI users encoding to match the stylesheet—i.e.,
 choosing tagging on the basis of how it will be displayed via
 our XSLT. DO agrees that we don't want to suggest there is a
 single canonical way of representing TEI, but having
 stylesheets tailored for standard use cases would be helpful;
 can our stylesheets be made more modular? AC cited as a sample
 use case a stylesheet using the 
 transcr module that would align transcription with
 original image. Or (LR) the Correspondence SIG could work on
 improving stylesheet rendering for epistolary texts. TMB noted
 that her users particularly like a service that allows them to
 submit a small TEI\-XML file and get back an HTML. Question:
 should we provide complete examples of encoding and rendering?
 EP points out that we long ago made a decision
 
 not to do this because it would appear too
 normative.


Consensus: Although we don't want to provide
 
 tools per se, stylesheets are important
 to our mission. Providing and/or disseminating useful ones
 should be considered part of our educational and outreach
 mission. 
 DO will produce
 several example texts and SR will provide
 some sample renderings using them.






 Projects and Outreach
 
 
 Creation of element examples in the Guidelines
 
 This agenda item involved the examples of tagging that are
 included in the Guidelines (and other TEI documents).


JC proposed that we might want to come up with a new framework
 for examples. Examples are found in multiple places and are
 not identified by language. Sometimes examples of one element
 provide good examples of another one but there is no way to
 find them. Can we internationalize examples and improve
 indexing and retrieval of them?


There followed some technical discussion of approaches we
 might take, e.g. extending the content model of
 
 elementSpec so that it could point to more
 examples; using XInclude to pull in examples from elsewhere;
 using XPointer to point to examples in alternate languages;
 using standoff markup... 


In the meantime, however, we need to improve the current
 coverage of examples for elements in the Guidelines. SR
 estimates that about 10% of TEI elements in the reference
 section do not carry examples, and sets off to determine which
 these are in real time as the meeting proceeds. 
 Everyone: Council members are
 each assigned a module and will create examples for
 elements lacking them from [Sebastian's final list](http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/P5/noeg.html), with assignments as
 follows. Examples to be sent to LB; for newly authored
 examples, provide a bibliographic citation. (Also, check
 the “Note” for each element, if one exists, to be sure its
 text remains correct for the latest release of P5\.)



* analysis: DO
* core: DS
* dictionaries: PS
* figures: JW
* gaiji: GB
* header: DO
* iso\-fs: LR
* linking: GB
* msdescription: JC
* namesdates: AC
* nets: LR
* spoken: PB
* tagdocs: TMB
* textcrit: EP
* textstructure: PB
* transcr: EP


As a final point, PB observed that the content model (in the
 “Declaration” section of the element reference) is too
 complicated, and would prefer a prose description. LB points
 out that this would not be maintainable. Consensus: do not
 pursue. 




 Internationalization
 
 SR reports that over that past two years, 5 or 6 groups have
 been working on translation of the reference portions of the
 Guidelines. Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, and
 Italian are being done manually. Within the next few weeks the
 first 5 languages should be complete (?? which?).


Oxford is testing automated translation software from Systran
 that is being evaluated as a way of translating additional
 languages (as a first pass; human editors would need to clean
 up the translations). We might be able to get another 3 or 4
 languages done this year using it. For example, a native
 Portuguese speaker estimated it might take about 3 days to
 clean up the automatic Portuguese translation.


Question: how do we maintain the translations? The Systran
 license is for one year only. Consensus: community\-based
 translation is the only viable way of maintaining
 translations, by having the user communities take
 responsibility for them.




 ISO proposal
 
 (SR) Last autumn the [ISO](http://www.iso.org/) put out a call for bids on preparing a document
 template and schema for authoring future ISO standards
 documents. Oxford U. responded with a proposal for doing it in
 TEI. An ISO committee visited Oxford and the proposal is in
 the process of being accepted; we are now waiting for formal
 confirmation. The ISO would contract with Oxford to: draw up
 an ODD representation of an ISO standards document (including
 SVG and MathML). Transforms from MS Word to TEI would be
 assigned to someone at Brigham Young University. Copyright for
 the ODD would be given to the TEI Consortium, to issue under
 an open\-source license. 


We agreed that if this agreement is reached, one benefit to
 the TEI community would be our branding of the standard. SR
 feels that it will be some time before documents are actually
 authored in TEI (rather than converted from MS Word), but LB
 notes that it will be more likely for documents that define
 new schemas.


We then discussed whether to seek ISO status for the ODD
 schema specification. Although ODD is currently used mainly
 within the TEI community, SR reports that one W3C project is
 using it. LR outlines 3 possible options for proceeding: (1\)
 start working on it as a continuation of ISO\-doc project, and
 take a proposal to the ISO technical management board; (2\):
 submit ODD as a candidate on a fast\-track procedure as a
 generic standard for schema specification (but a problem is
 that it would have to go into the same generic IT committee
 that considered the MS Office XML format; (3\) reduce scope and
 visibility by going to a committee like [TC37](http://www.tc37sc4.org/), so as to be
 seen as a candidate specification for language resource
 applications.


LB raises a concern about whether ODD is yet stable enough to
 proceed. Also, will people object that ODD is just an expanded
 schema language that does nothing which W3C XML Schema cannot
 do? (SR notes that any consideration of ODD would logically
 belong in [JTC
 1/SC 34 \- Document Description and Processing
 Languages](http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/), where NVDL and RELAX NG live.)


Is this worth our time and resources? Is it within our
 mission? Consensus: yes, this would bring benefits to the
 current TEI community and would serve as outreach to the
 larger XML community. It would return benefits to us if more
 native TEI applications result, along with a more stable ODD
 language. We will begin exploring this with the relevant
 people within the standards community. 
 LR will talk to his contacts.





 TEI Tite
 
 DO reported on the status of TEI Tite and the [study
 underway](http://cirss.lis.uiuc.edu/DigHum/tei.html) headed by John Unsworth and Perry Trolard to
 project the demand and uses for the TEI Tite customization
 intended to be used for digitizing printed material such as
 monographs in bulk quantities. The study will also explore
 including access to a consortial vendor agreement as a TEI
 Member benefit. Both potential clients and keyboarding vendors
 will be surveyed as part of the study.


All agreed that there needs to be closer integration of the
 work on Tite into Council activities, and improved lines of
 communication. 
 DO will try
 to set up a conference call with John Unsworth, to include
 PS, JW, DS, and LR.





 ENRICH project
 
 JC reports on the [ENRICH
 Project](http://enrich.manuscriptorium.com/) (European Networking Resources and Information
 concerning Cultural Heritage), a two\-year project that LB and
 SR have previously worked with and that JC will be in the
 future. The aim is twofold: to aggregate metadata for medieval
 manuscripts in a single portal, and to have the archives
 standardize on TEI P5 as a data format. The Czech Republic is
 committed to long\-term maintenance of the project. (Note that
 Manuscriptorium, the portal site, is a commercial enterprise;
 this is not an open\-access project. However, the ENRICH ODD
 and conversion XSLT stylesheets for Master2TEI will be made
 publicly available under an open source license.)





 Forthcoming Events, Conferences, Etc.
 
 Here we discussed our collective or individual participation in
 various upcoming meetings.


* TEI Members Meeting. We will plan on some sort of
 face\-to\-face Council meeting; we don't currently have TEI
 Consortium budget for more than one annual face\-to\-face
 meeting (but we will investigate the possibility). (LR
 suggests we should try to have a meeting, whether
 face\-to\-face or via conference call, about once every two
 months.) Question: do we still need to distribute live CD's
 at the meeting? Consensus: no, but we should be prepared to
 distribute the most current pre\-release version of the
 Guidelines, in digital form. If possible we should
 distribute it on USB key drives as a freebie.
* Dublin Core 2008\. LR reports that it will be held in
 Berlin in September 2008\. LR will attend and present an
 overview of the TEI. Ideally someone else from Council
 should attend on 26 September, to assist with a slot
 involving metadata.
* Oxford Summer School. SR reports that Oxford will
 conduct a [3\-day summer school on TEI\-XML](http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2008-07-oxford_summer_school/), plus 2 days on
 TEI and XSLT, during the third week of July.
* "Camp Edit": DS will offer a session on TEI in digital
 documentary editions at [Camp Edit](http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/about/campedit/index.asp), the annual training institute for
 historical documentary editors at the University of
 Wisconsin, Madison. He notes that interest in TEI among
 editors of historical documents has been growing rapidly in
 North America in the last couple of years.




 Final Discussion, Wrap\-up
 
 LR summarizes our accomplishments during our meeting: handling
 the SourceForge bugs and feature requests, opening new windows
 for outreach activities, planning the 
 Getting
 Started document and agreeing to pursue the
 Correspondence SIG. 


Unresolved issues? We still have to iron out some of the
 relations between Board and Council with respect to outreach
 responsibilities. In the past, there was the notion that the
 Board's job was to 
 get members and the
 Council's to 
 produce stuff. We now
 acknowledge that there are technical aspects to outreach that the
 Council should logically handle. But Council is not being asked
 to do everything.


SR wonders whether we need to promulgate a road map to P6 now.
 Should we have an answer if asked what's our plan for P6?
 Consensus after discussion is that this year our mission is
 development of training and support. Eventually Council will make
 a recommendation to the Board about a schedule for preparation
 and release of P6; but a fully new P6 release will come about
 only as a response to major external requirements (for example,
 if the W3C established an XML specification that enabled
 overlapping hierarchies!). In the meantime there will be P5 point
 releases. (SR still feels that we ought to let people know to
 what extent plans for P6 are in the works.)


LB suggests that the Board be requested to consider providing
 funding for groups making the transition from P4 to P5\. (??
 elaborate on this)


The TEI website still needs improvements. 
 DO will take up website issues with the Web
 committee and the Board.



The Critical Apparatus chapter in the Guidelines seriously needs
 revision and should be a priority.


Left unresolved were decisions about future face\-to\-face
 meetings. The productivity of our bug/FR session suggests that a
 twice\-yearly schedule might be worthwhile. 
 ALL need to decide on our next face\-to\-face
 meeting; London in November, or potentially a September
 meeting. (Following the meeting, JC suggested that we could
 aim to do this following the Digital Resources in the
 Humanities and Arts conference (14–17 Sept. in
 Cambridge, UK.)



In the future, Council may want to consider its call for hosting
 as part of our outreach mission, including a mini\-conference as
 we have done in Galway.
