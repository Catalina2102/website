 Update on[correspDescproposal](https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/510/) (PWS)
 
 
- [https://github.com/TEI\-Correspondence\-SIG/correspDesc](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/correspDesc)

- PWS believe this is ready to be added to trunk; if no\-one objects, he proposes to
 go ahead with this a week from now. There is one problem with proposed values for
 @type, but he suspects this is due to namespaces and will disappear with integration
 (although this suggests a bug in the Stylesheets that should be filed).

 have been made in content models.
