# TCM10: TEI Council Conference Call



The following were present: Syd Bauman (SB), Alejandro Bia (AB),
 David Birnbaum (DB) in part, Lou Burnard (LB), Matthew Driscoll (MD),
 David Durand (DD), Tomaz Erjavec (TE), Julia Flanders (JF), Sebastian
 Rahtz (SR),
 Susan Schreibman (SS), Natasha Smith (NS), Edward Vanhoutte (EV),
 Perry Willett (PW), Christian Wittern (CW).
 


Apologies had been received from Laurent Romary; DB joined the
 meeting half way through after an unfortunate elevator\-related incident.
 


Actions from [previous meeting](/Activities/Council/Meetings/tcm09.xml) were reviewed: 
 
 + \[3] Roma development list has been established and
 seen a little traffic.
+ \[5] No further progress from the SO group and no
 report submitted. On today's agenda.
+ \[7] CW reported that John Smith had set up a workgroup
 on Sanskrit encoding issues, which was likely to deliver
 recommendations of more general scope. LB reported that the
 group seems to have independently re\-invented
 the 
 choice mechanism.
 CWASAP
 request Sanskrit WG to produce a report for
 consideration at the Council meeting in May.
+ \[8] CW reported that, on further consideration, he
 felt these topics were better left to the Board. No one disagreed.
+ \[9] CW reported that
 so far only the Meta workgroup had requested funding. Of the $20k
 allocated for workgroup activities in the current year, about
 half was currently uncommitted..


* CW reported on the CE workgroup's output. Council reviewed
 CEW06 and endorsed it as a replacement for the current WSD
 chapter in P5, with the proviso that some better name than
 "WSD\-NG" be found.
 At its last meeting, the WG agreed that a statement about the role
 of `xml:lang` in P5 would be useful. It was suggested this
 might fit into the document CEW04, work on which seemed to have stagnated.

* Council noted with concern the continued lack of progress
 from the StandOff Workgroup, for which DD accepted
 responsibility. Over the weekend, SB had formulated a work
 plan for addressing the most urgent needs, which he
 volunteered to work closely with DD on accomplishing. The
 workplan is summarized in a note, details of which had yet to be
 agreed by the workgroup, but which mostly involve SB and DD working
 closely on some existing documents.

 Noting that getting another person up to speed
 in time for P5 would be difficult, and that other wg members
 (e.g. Fabio Vitale) were just as short of time, Council agreed
 in principle to this plan, on the assumption that SB and DD
 would meet regularly, and that LB and JF would monitor progress.

* In the absence of LR, LB reported progress in the
 joint ISO/TEI feature structure group. The recent Korean
 meeting had been very productive, and a fairly complete draft
 agreed. Some issues were still under debate within the group
 (notably the best way of representing re\-entrant structures)
 but it was still planned to have a final draft for
 consideration by the Council in May. Several members of the
 group would be meeting informally at the LREC conference in
 Lisbon shortly before the next Council Meeting and any
 outstanding problems should be resolved by that date. A
 further meeting of the ISO TC37/WG4 was planned for Paris in
 August, which LB planned to attend.
 DD noted that the document FSW01 did not give any 
 rationale for or discussion of the changes made between P4 and
 P5,being simply a summary. More discussion is available in the draft;
 LB also noted that a list of implementations of the current P4 system
 was included as an ISO deliverable, so liaison with that user
 community should not be too difficult.

* MD reported that the group had mostly been waiting for
 the ODD format to stabilize so that a new draft could be
 prepared. LB had only recently converted the existing Master
 documentation to the new format; once this was done it was
 planned to start implementing the basic revisions agreed at
 the Reykjavik meeting. This would be completed before any
 further expansion of content, and would be ready in time for
 the May meeting.

* SR reported that the Metalanguage workgroup had held a very
 productive meeting in Paris, following which the ODD language
 had been further revised. The new draft for TD was well on course for
 P5, and the editorial toolkit was now functional (i.e. the draft TD document
 generates schemas and DTDs which validate it). Some more
 implementation work remained for TEI customizations, but the
 basic mechanism was now in place. It had also been agreed that
 internationalization would use the same mechanism as customization.
 


SR was confident that the work would be complete by early
 May. Council members were urged to study this documentation,
 since it is the one part of the TEI which all future
 developers and workgroup heads need to understand fully.


It was suggested that additional tutorial material should be
 prepared to complement the basic reference material in this draft. JF
 mentioned that the 


WWP Encoding Guide was currently
 being revised and would include a section on P5 migration, which might usefully include
 a layman's explanation and case study on how to do customization. SR suggested
 that the Ibsen project also had a major customization and that he had
 been working with Tone Merete Brevik on porting this to P5\.

 facilities

* Council then discussed the proposal for a new workgroup
 on Physical Bibliography, previously circulated by JF. Its
 main objective would be detailed recommendation for the
 encoding of collation
 formulae and of the phenomena corresponding with them in
 running text. Council discussed possible synergy with the work
 of the MS group and other projects, and approved formation of the group
 conditional on further clarification of its exact remit. DB
 would be visiting Brown mid\-April and would be able to
 contribute his own experience to the project.
 
 DB

 Send details of previous completed work on encoding of collation sequences
 to JF.
 
JF
2004\-04\-15
 Draft and circulate to Council a proposed charge to the Physical
 Bibliography workgroup

* Under AOB, there was some discussion of future meetings:
	+ The 2004 Members' Meeting
	 will be held at John's Hopkins on 
	 22
	 \& 23 Oct. MD will be doing a workshop there in
	 April.
	+ EV had prepared a website with details of accomodation etc. for
	 the Council face to face meeting in May. He would investigate possibility of
	 group hotel rates. SS requested that all documents for the meeting
	 be made available on the website
	 well in advance, i.e. by 
	 06 May at the latest.
