Impressions from MM2006There was interesting discussion of event element
 at the Ontology SIG in Victoria??. Recommendation that we
 invite someone from Ontology SIG to extension of
 personography meeting.
 
 DOD reports plans to expand ASIG participation in programme
 for MM2007; e.g. the
 goal is to run a working paper session for which the papers
 would be circulated beforehand, and then be presented at MM
 or to ask SIGs to make a full presentation on a
 topic.
 
 
Workgroup etc. progress
 
 PBMD still needs to rewrite the examples MM provides in the
 PB document using a more generic mechanism (action from 2
 calls ago, repeated here with invented due date: MD
 Rewrite the examples MM provides in the PB
 document using a more generic mechanism
 2006\-12\-31\)
 
 
PERSDiscussed above.
 
 
I18NSR reports he inadvertently sent report to CW instead of
 group; this was corrected during the call, it has now been
 sent [to
 the list](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2006/001979.html), but note that the presentation the
 report refers to is [really
 here](http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2006-10-victoria/i18n-0.xhtml). Changes to Roma were reported at MM. The
 question was raised as to whether or not there are
 sufficient funds to permit a 2nd person to proofread
 translations. SR informed council that the intention is
 that monies will be spent by the translators as they see
 fit … they might pay for a proofreader or not.
 
 The issue of translations of examples was discussed.
 Questions include which examples get put directly into the ODDs,
 which ones are stand\-off? Suggestion to have multiple
 examples in various languages in the reference section
 (not the prose). Need to develop infrastructure for
 stating whether an example is a translation of another, or
 an added new example, etc. LB
 ponder and post discussion of multilingual example
 problem, particularly with an eye towards whether or
 not the ODD encoding language defined by TD needs to
 be updated
 2006\-01\-10
 
 SR reports that there is also a lot of infrastructure
 work to be done, e.g. formatting multilingual Guidelines
 as PDF.
 
 The timeline is to have the translations themselves
 completed by Spring, and the entire multilingual project
 including the infrastructure and tying the translations to
 the whole Guidelines by MM2007\.
 
 

Document review and updates
 
 Text and Image encodingDiscussion of [CT \&
 DP's document](http://www.rch.uky.edu/image_encoding.html) deferred, as it's still being worked on.
 
 

Road to P5
 
 ConformanceThe consensus was to ask JC to summarize discussion so
 far and write a proposal that will eventually become
 replacement for CFJC
 summarize discussion of conformance and write a proposal

Feature requests on SFStatus of SF requests document needs to be
 updated. eds.
 update doc, report to group when done

Meetings
 
 Face\-to\-faceWe're looking at Berlin in late April, perhaps at
 26/27all
 let list know if you expect to be
 available for a meeting in Berlin Thu 26 \& Fri 27 Apr
 072006\-12\-06
 
 
next conference callDOD reports that although Board discussed other meetings
 at locations that submitted unsuccessful bids for
 MM2007, he does not feel that Council meeting should be
 tied to them.
 
 CW will be in Taiwan in late Feb 2007\.
 
 Next conference call was scheduled for Tue 23 Jan 07 at 12:00\.
 
 SR \& DOD will be investigating other teleconferencing systems.
 It was suggested that CW be included in any tests. Both
 Oxford and Indiana have Adobe Breeze set up. JW has used
 it, and reports that at least for a simple presentation it
 is quite good. High\-speed conferences.com seems plausible
 — can accept calls from Skype or phone. SR
 report on high speed conferences .com system
