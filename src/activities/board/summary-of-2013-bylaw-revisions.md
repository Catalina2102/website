# Summary of 2013 Bylaw Revisions




Following extensive discussion and consultation, the TEI Board of
 Directors has agreed a number of proposed revisions to the existing
 bylaws governing the organisation and conduct of the TEI
 Consortium. In accordance with Article 7 of the current bylaws,
 acceptance of these revised bylaws will be voted upon at the
 forthcoming TEI election. Members are requested to consider the
 revised bylaws as a whole before voting. A copy is attached to this
 notice.


A summary of the changes introduced by these revisions follows. For
 completeness, members can also access and compare 
 [the proposed
 revision](/Board/bylaws2013.xml), [the current (2011\)
 version](/About/bylaws.xml) of the bylaws online, and a [redlined version showing changes](/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bylaws2013-redlined.pdf).

 numbers refer to the current bylaws, except as indicated.
