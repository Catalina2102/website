# TEI Board Meeting 31 2008: Board Meeting Addendum: Strategic Travel





Proposal: Strategic Travel
 
  Last year we set aside $2000\.00 for strategic ("Emissary") travel.
 I propose that we repeat this, with some modifications.


Purpose
 
 The purpose of this money is to accommodate requests for TEI funded travel not associated
 with the Members' or Council meeting. Examples from the past include funding a representative
 to travel to a DLF meeting and partially covering the cost of travel of representatives
 to a TEI day in Russia and a conference in Northern Africa. In other words, we have
 used this type of fund to cover some administrative travel and some community\-building
 travel.



 Procedure
 
  In the past the board as approved expenses in this category on an ad hoc basis. Going
 forward, I would like to propose that we assign these funds on the basis of written
 proposals only. Such proposals must provide an explanation of purpose, a budget, and
 a justification of this travel in relation to the TEI goals. The board would then
 vote on the proposal at its next scheduled meeting.
