 SWOTStrengths,
 Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

 Roundtable
In this section of the meeting, we will look at the strategic issues
 facing us: what opportunities, weaknesses, threats, and strengths do
 we see as Board members? On the basis of the members' meeting, and
 information covered Saturday evening and before lunch today, each
 member should prepare to suggest at least one area of strenght,
 weakness, opportunity, or 
 threat for us to
 consider. After we have written these up, we will look for
 commonalities, and ultimately rank the resulting list in terms of
 importance. For this section we should be thinking in broad terms
 rather than in terms of specific programmes or budget items.
* 13:55\-14:10 Break
* 14:10\-15:05 RFP Process 
In 2009 we asked with the four hosts whose terms were coming to an
 end to extend our current arrangement for another year. In 2010, we
 will be required to issue a Request for Proposals for the four host
 positions that are coming to conclusion. The relevant section of the
 Bylaws is VI.3:
 ...the Board of Directors shall select a
 minimum of four TEI\-C Hosts, using a public Request for
 Proposals process. Hosts may be re\-appointed for second and
 subsequent terms, but they must participate in the RFP process.
 In the event that a Host representative vacates one of the four
 Host seats on the TEI\-C Board and there are at that time more
 than four Hosts, the remaining Hosts shall collectively select
 the replacement Board member. In the event that there are fewer
 than four Hosts, the seat on the Board shall be empty until
 filled by the normal Host selection process. In selecting Hosts,
 the Board of Directors shall respect those fundamental
 principles of the TEI\-C calling for international and
 interdisciplinary representation. Hosts must be members of the
 TEI\-C. Hosts shall serve for a minimum four\-year term, and shall
 agree, in addition to a membership fee, to provide support
 services for the TEI\-C and to organize, convene, or assist in
 TEI\-C meetings. Hosts may also assist the TEI\-C in recruiting
 members, raising endowment, providing training or consulting to
 members, and disseminating information and tools relevant to the
 use of TEI.As a first step in proposing an RFP for Hosts
 for 2011\-2014, we should devote some time now to considering the
 support services this RFP should request. What services does the TEI
 require in the next four years? Given that the TEI has changed
 structurally and in terms of mandate since the Host positions were
 first established, we should start our deliberations by considering
 the question of services broadly, regardless of whether or not they
 fall under the ambit of a current host. We will then look once again
 for commonalities and, time permitting, consider how we would like
 to advance the process of designing suitable RFPs.
* 15:05\-15:15 Coffee Break
* 15:15\-15:45 Next steps
In this section will will discuss how we would like the board to
 function this coming year and upcoming actions and deliberations
 (such as determining the 2010 budget)
* 15:45\-16:00 Closing remarks and comments
* 16:00 Adjournment
