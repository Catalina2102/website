### Agenda Items

* Approval of September minutes (JC proposed acceptance, CC seconded)
* Discussion of joint membership idea that was raised at TEI2024:
  * Those who cannot afford multiple memberships (e.g., 
SHARP, ESTS, STS, ADE etc) might be interested in bundled membership
    * Could drive engagement, especially regionally
    * Shouldnâ€™t add giant administrative overhead
    * Will continue to discuss in consultation with other TEI-C groups.
* Membership drive -- this will be the big goal for 2024-5
* TEI Community Forums
  * Real enthusiasm for this idea; the Board enthusiastically approves the initiative!
    * Raff and Joey will host two community meetup parties online in November
* Opening TEI-C.slack.com
  * Should we open Slack to the community, as less formal place to post questions?
    * Board approves moving ahead with this initiative, with the understanding that there will be some planning and organization of how Slack will function, who will moderate, etc.
* TEI2025
  * We have received expressions of interest from 2 potential hosts; James Cummings is serving as point-person with bidding organizations.
