Policy for funding of catering of business meetings
---------------------------------------------------


Proposal to approve a general policy for reimbursement for catering during business meetings incl. additional expenses like coffee etc.: general policy is already there. How to put it into practice?
Problem if chair cannot forward the money: preferred solution would be a company credit card.


LR: occasionally occurring costs can be collected and reimbursed by a member of council/board


MD: credit card would allow smoothing expenses for keynote speaker as well


**KT to email Tim Naughton with cc to Hugh to ask about company credit card for Council Chair.**


Updates Membership Drive
========================


LR: peak in new members, e.g. Ottawa and others as supporter, since start of membership drive, correlation not completely clear \=\> compare development with previous period to have a statistically more solid argument.
Pay attention to switch it off before it becomes boring.


Only one critical reaction.


Communication with members / community
--------------------------------------


MD: think about communication channels in general; maybe collect reactions via TEI\-L? Send out general mails to members?
LR: In particular to institutional members: show administrative people that the TEI is working.


GV: I think sending around an annual report to the members would be good practice to show what is happening to their money.


KT: is willing to write a short narrative.


MD: Virtual should be able to do it.


make a financial report public could be good for legal reasons as well.


GV: publish slides of member meeting


LR: don’t forget TEI\-L as main communication channel of community. The releases is essential in demonstrating our activity.


KT: will insert references to this in the report.


LR: collection of names for releases?
