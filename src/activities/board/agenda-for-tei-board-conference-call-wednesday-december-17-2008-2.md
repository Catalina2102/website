Proposal: Subscriber Fees
 
 This is a pro\-forma description of the proposal we have been discussing on the list
 to create three categories of subscribers. Currently, the proposal is as can be found
 at the draft shopping cart: [http://zencart2\.kakelbont.homelinux.net/](http://zencart2.kakelbont.homelinux.net/):
 


* Concessionary $40
* Affiliate $80
* Supporter $120


The current subscriber rate is $50\. We currently have 20 subscribers. In exchange
 for the Subscriber fee, we currently grant free access to the conference. In my view
 this should be changed to approximately 30% off. We also should let people buy the
 P5 manual at cost.
