May 11, 2001
 
 
 
 John Unsworth called the meeting to order and the following 
 business was conducted.



 Certification
 
 
 The Board certified that due notice of the meeting was given two 
 weeks in advance.




 Approval and Adjustment of the Agenda
 
 
 The Board adjusted and approved the agenda to include discussions 
 of document numbering, the budget for 2002\-2004, and the schedule for 
 the following day's meeting on May 12\.




 Election of Recording Secretary
 
 
 The Secretary remarked that the minutes would not include 
 transcriptions of the discussions. Rather, they would record points 
 made and actions taken. The Board accepted Julia Flanders's and Jan 
 Hajic's offer to take transcriptive notes to aid the Secretary in 
 preparing the minutes.




 The Executive Director's Report
 
 
 Tone Merete Bruvik noted that the TEI Consortium was formally 
 established in December 2000, that Claus Huitfeldt and Kristine 
 Breivik (temporarily serving as executive director) visited Brown, 
 Virginia and Oxford in January, that she (Tone Merete) started March 
 1st, and that she visited Brown and Virginia in March and Oxford in 
 April to discuss matters pertaining to the consortium.


 Tone Merete next explained how the consortium is being 
 managed at Bergen. Tone Merete focuses on membership recruitment and 
 general management issues; Kristine assists Claus Huitfeldt with 
 management of the budget; Torill Revheim assists with accounting and 
 membership management; and Anne Lindebjerg helps prepare 
 publications. Tone Merete expressed her appreciation for their help 
 in supporting the activities of the consortium


 Tone Merete noted that she has done most of the updating of 
 the membership contact database established by John Unsworth. 
 However, she urged Board members to update the database themselves as 
 they move through the process of recruiting members.


 Tone Merete then reported on the status of the consortium's 
 membership. To date, Consortium has: 
 




| Paid members | 6 |
| --- | --- |
| Members invoiced but unpaid | 6 |
| Agreements to become members | 6 |
| Agreement to join in 2002 | 1 |
| Individual subscribers | 2 |


 Tone Merete estimated that the membership fees for the above 
 will amount to $51,350\.


 She noted that of the 60 institutions in the contact database, 14 
 have become members (4 from Europe and 10 from the U.S.)


 Several Board members reported that additional agreements 
 have been made with other institutions and projects which were not 
 included in Tone Merete's report. The Board then briefly discussed 
 the need to expand recruitment in Europe and the issue of negotiating 
 membership levels.


 John Unsworth pointed out that while negotiations are 
 sometimes necessary to place a member in the appropriate level (div 
 0, div1, div2, div3\), the fees for each category of membership are 
 not negotiable. In the case of Modern Language Association which 
 offered a $1,000 "contribution," the membership level was set at div3 
 ($500\) and the remainder considered as a contribution.




 Budgets for 2001, 2002\-2004
 
 
  Claus Huitfeldt distributed the revised budgets for 2001 and 
 2002\-2004\. Both were based on the initial projections in the business 
 plan and will need to be modified in light of 1\) the $128,482 grant 
 from the National Endowment for the Humanities; 2\) adjustments to the 
 revenue projections; and 3\) adjustments to the expenditure 
 projections. Discussion of the NEH grant was deferred for the 
 moment.


 The Board agreed that the revisions should be undertaken by 
 John Unsworth and Claus Huitfeldt. Several general points made during 
 the Board's discussion included:
 


* the need to adjust expenses for inflation
* the need to adjust training and work group projections
* the need to adjust membership income projections




 Overview of Editors' Activities
 
 
  Lou Burnard reported that his major activities included 
 consultancies for six projects in the UK, TEI presentations at six 
 meetings (2 in France, 1 each in England, Spain, India, and Italy), 
 and conducting three TEI workshops at Oxford and workshops at other 
 sites.


 Steve DeRose reported his major activities included work with 
 the W3C X\-Link work group with a major focus on gaining acceptance 
 for the TEI x\-pointer mechanism as well as work on the revisions of 
 the TEI Guidelines (P3\) and training for the TEI work group on 
 medieval manuscripts.




 Overview of the NEH Proposal
 
 
  Steve DeRose explained that the NEH proposal was drafted by 
 Allen Renear to support the XMLization of the TEI Guidelines. John 
 Unsworth noted that the grant is worded as though we are leaving SGML 
 behind. Antonio Zampolli raised the issue of whether or not earlier 
 TEI documents would be compatible. Steve DeRose replied that the 
 earlier documents would in fact not be compatible. Further discussion 
 of the issue was postponed until the Saturday discussion on the NEH 
 proposal.




 Review of the Work Groups
 
 
  Lou Burnard reported that both the Master Project (an EU 
 project) and the Medieval Manuscripts Work Group are actively working 
 to develop a
 markup system for the cataloging of medieval manuscripts which would extend
 the TEI Guidelines. He recommended that the work of both groups be 
 reviewed.


 Further discussion indicated that the two groups may possibly
 collaborate and produce a single markup system. After an extensive
 discussion on the current activities of the two groups, John Unsworth asked
 Lou Burnard to invite both groups to file reports by June 1\. The Board
 voted unanimously in favor of this action.




 Review of the Consortium Council and Nominations
 
 
  John Unsworth noted that the Council governs the technical aspects
 of the consortium and the Board of Directors governs the business of the
 consortium.


 The Board discussed the election procedures to be used in selecting
 members of the Council and filling the two seats on the Board of Directors
 and agreed to the following:
 


* The Nominating Committee shall nominate candidates for six
 positions on the Council and for two seats on the Board both to serve for
 two year terms.
* The Board will appoint four members of the Council to serve
 one\-year terms in order to have a full Council.
* Elections will be held the next year to fill the appointed seats
 on the Council and the newly elected members will serve two\-year
 terms\-\-thus alternating elections the Council so that six members are
 elected the first year and four members are elected the next year, etc.
* The Nominating Committee will nominate more than six people for
 the Council and more than two people for the Board in order to provide
 members with a choice of candidates.
* The Nominating Committee will make recommendations to the Board
 as to who should be appointed to the Council for one\-year terms.
* The Nominating Committee will ask potential candidates for the
 Council whether they are willing to be nominated for appointment and/or
 nominated to stand for election. No candidate will be put forth who has not
 agreed in writing to serve if elected or appointed.
* The Board amended the by\-laws to enable the TEI editors to serve
 on the Nominating Committee and then elected the following people to serve
 on the committee:
	+ Julia Flanders, Chair
	+ Lou Burnard
	+ David Chesnutt
	+ Jan Hajic
	+ Antonio Zampolli


 Board members suggested a number of persons to be considered for
 the nominations to the Council and to the Board. Rather than extend the
 conversation further, the Board agreed to forward the names of all
 potential candidates to the Nominating Committee.


 The Board adjourned for lunch and then reconvened.




 Discussion of Changes to By\-Laws
 
 
  Claus Huitfeldt distributed copies of TEI charter, articles of
 incorporation, by\-laws, membership agreement and business plan.


 The Board voted to act on the recommended changes to the by\-laws
 without submitting the changes to the membership for ratification. The
 changes included changes in the wording:


* to reflect that the fiscal year is the calendar year
* to allow for\-profit entities full membership privileges


 The first change, adopted by acclamation, substitutes January 1 for
 June 1 in Article II.1 and December 31 for June 30 in Article III.5


The second change, adopted unanimously, omits the words "Non\-profit
 projects" and adding the words "projects and companies" in the first
 sentence of Article I.1\.A so that it now reads:
 Institutions, consortia, organizations, projects and companies can
 be members of the TEI\-C.



 The Board discussed but made no change in Article VII of the
 by\-laws which sets forth procedures for amending the by\-laws.


 The Board agreed to take up the remainder of the agenda on 
 Saturday.





 May 12, 2001
 
 
  The Board reconvened at 9:30 a.m.



 Discussion of the NEH grant
 
 
  The Board agreed that the Consortium should maintain both forms
 (XML and SGML) of the TEI DTD. Lou Burnard explained that the system used
 to generate the DTD and the Guidelines can accomplish this by simply having
 a "switch" which determines which DTD is to be generated.


 Lou Burnard reported that the editors expect to have draft versions
 of the new DTDs completed before the ACH\-ALLC conference in New York City
 on June 14\. Once the draft is completed, Lou Burnard suggested that the
 following steps should be taken:


* Testing of the new DTDs by various projects
* Survey of existing projects to determine if they are migrating to XML
* Updating the Guidelines with examples appropriate to XML


 An extended discussion about the "Pizza Chef" software revealed
 that the LEX programs which allow users to customize the DTDs will not
 handle Unicode and will therefore limit what people can do. John Unsworth
 pointed out that revision of the Pizza Chef system is not part of the NEH
 work plan and would have to be deferred until later.


 The next discussion focused on defining the work and the Board
 agreed to the following items:


* Conversion to XML by implementing EDW69 which defines the
 changes which need to be made
* Development of XML tools (XSL stylesheets) to replace all
 of the old P1 and P3 Snobol tools
* Edit the Guidelines to replace inappropriate SGML text and
 examples
* Survey users to determine what their plans are and what
 tools are needed to accomplish those plans
* Develop the tools users need


 Lou Burnard and Steve DeRose are working on Item 1; Lou Burnard and
 Sebastian Rahtz are working on Item 2; Steve DeRose is working on Item 3;
 and Julia Flanders volunteered to work on Item 4\. Item 5 is to be deferred
 until Item 4 is completed.


 In terms of the budget, the Board concluded that John Unsworth and
 Claus Huitfeldt should re\-evaluate the 2001\-2002 general budget in light of
 the NEH budget; that they should draft new budgets; and that the budgets
 should be submitted to the Board and finalized versions presented at the
 Annual Meeting of the Membership.




 Miscellaneous Items
 
 
  The Board agreed to use up to $25,000 to fund a half\-time person to
 maintain, add new documents, and write technical documentation for the
 Consortium Web site.


 The Board accepted Antonio Zampolli's offer to organize the first
 Annual Membership Meeting at a site in Italy.


 John Unsworth appointed Sebastian Rahtz to conduct a survey to
 determine what training courses the Consortium should offer to members.


 The Board agreed with Lou Burnard's suggestion that Consortium
 documents be numbered and that a registry of documents be established at
 Bergen.


 The Board agreed that membership fees can be prorated if an
 applicant requests proration and agrees continue membership for a second
 year.


 The Board agreed that consortiums and other membership
 organizations like the Modern Language Association can join either as a
 single\-member with one vote or that they can negotiate a special rate for
 their members wherein each unit which joins would likewise have voting
 privileges.


 The Board adjourned after offering thanks and applause to the hosts
 Tone Merete Bruvik, Kristine Breivik, and Claus Huitfeldt.
