# TEI Board Meeting 31 2008: Board Meeting Addendum: Community Outreach Program






 Community Outreach Program
 
 
  This proposal describes a community outreach program focused on 
 providing the TEI community with access to TEI expertise, with 
 particular emphasis on TEI customization and schema design, encoding 
 documentation, and project strategy with respect to TEI encoding. In 
 this proposal we refer to this program as the "Community Outreach 
 Program" but better names can no doubt be found.


The goals of the Community Outreach Program are to assist groups and 
 individuals in developing successful TEI projects and funding proposals 
 for such projects, and to provide TEI members with access to advice and 
 consultancy on all aspects of TEI usage. For the most part, its services 
 would be offered as a membership benefit, although this would probably 
 not be possible to enforce closely.


Its activities include:
 
 


* 1\. TEI consultancy listing
	+ The COP would provide a listing of consultants who are competent to 
	 offer assistance in a broad range of TEI project development activities 
	 (schema customization, stylesheet development, conversions, grant 
	 proposal development, project planning, etc.) This listing would be 
	 informational only; the TEI would not make any guarantees of their 
	 competence or their work. However, to be listed all consultants would be 
	 asked to complete a form indicating their competence in specific areas 
	 (e.g. TEI customization; XSLT; project documentation; grant proposal 
	 writing; etc.) and the languages in which they are prepared to consult, 
	 and these areas would be indicated in the listing at the TEI site. The 
	 list would be kept current by the program's coordinator.
	
	
	 The expectation is that these consultants would be hired by projects, 
	 and paid out of project funds or grant funds. The program coordinator 
	 could offer advice in choosing a consultant (e.g. advice on what skills 
	 might be required for a particular project) but the choice and all 
	 arrangements (contract terms, payment, etc.) would be entirely up to the 
	 project and consultant to arrange.
	
	
	Fees would not be set by the TEI, although in order to be listed 
	 consultants would be expected to provide a discount to TEI members or 
	 subscribers, and in any case not to charge more than a maximum set by 
	 the TEI.
* 2\. Consultancy grant program
	+ The COP would support an annual grant program (target for disbursement 
	 in the first year might be 15K USD total) to provide support to small, 
	 pilot, or unfunded projects. This program would involve an annual call 
	 for proposals, with awards in the range of 2000 to 3000 USD. These funds 
	 could be used to cover consultant fees, travel, or both. (In some cases, 
	 consultants might agree to do this work pro bono, or while funded by 
	 another grant, in which case travel expenses might be the only cost). 
	 Proposals would be evaluated both on their merits and on their benefit 
	 to the TEI community: for instance, a successful proposal might be to 
	 develop a documented TEI customization for oral histories, or to develop 
	 a set of useful conversion stylesheets, or to develop a funding proposal 
	 to support some TEI\-related work. Applicants could include TEI SIGs, 
	 projects, organizations, or individuals. Successful applicants would be 
	 required to provide the TEI with any materials developed as a result of 
	 the grant.
* 3\. TEI grant assistance program
	+ The COP would also take over and formalize the TEI's existing grant 
	 assistance program. Consultants who are listed as willing/able to help 
	 projects develop grant proposals could indicate whether they are willing 
	 to do so pro bono on a purely advisory basis (as is now the case), and 
	 projects seeking such assistance could request it from the program 
	 coordinator, who would match the project with an appropriate consultant. 
	 For very large grant proposals, this might be a paid consulting activity 
	 but we expect this to be rare.
	
	
	The types of outside projects that would be the primary focus for the
	 COP are those that are developing materials, guidelines, or 
	 customizations that are for use by more than one project. E.g. things 
	 like MEP, EpiDoc, or TEI in Libraries. That is, the most important focus 
	 would be on assisting groups or projects to produce materials which are 
	 potentially of value to the wider TEI community or portions thereof.
