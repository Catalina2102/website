# TEI Board Meeting 31 2008: Board Meeting Addendum: Strategic Travel





 
 Council meetings in 2009
 
 
 We suggest that, if budget permits, the council is supported to hold 
 two face to face meetings in 2008\. Several arguments may plea in 
 favour of such a regularity:
 


* The group has proved to be very efficient in face to face 
 discussions since it allows a clear comparison of views and the 
 capacity to provide concrete illustrations of technical discussions;
* The constant turnover on council members requires that team building 
 aspects are taken into consideration to ensure that we all have the 
 same background in designing, implementing, but also explaining our 
 strategy and choices;
* The recent stabilization of existing P5 content requires that the 
 council identifies its priorities and has the capacity to define a mid\- 
 term technical strategy. Part of the F2F meetings has to be dedicated 
 to this strategic planning;
* The editorial work behind the "getting started into the TEI" 
 activity requires actual exchanges among council contributors and 
 direct feedback with council members;
* The combination of council meetings with a local seminar has proved 
 to be a strong element of the consortium outreaching activities since 
 it allowed for both a better perception of how the TEI maintain the 
 guidelines and for the council a better understanding our the 
 community needs. This in turn brings budgetal benefits if we can 
 acheive some local support and attract new members (a TEI flyer to be 
 distributed locally; comprising a little section on "why become a 
 member" could be valuable).


We already have two bids for the hosting of council meeting in 2009 
 from Lyon (FR) and Dublin (IR). Since these meetings would be close to 
 the center of gravity of council members, we could anticipate a rather 
 lower budget for both (below 12Kâ‚¬ each in any case). These meetings 
 could take place in en of March and end of September.


We would also like to prepare a meeting in the US in early 2009 to 
 liaise closely with the corresponding (digital) library community 
 (Virginia?).


Update on this proposal:
 


* Lyon is confirming invitation for March and will have a budget for 
 at least dinner, coffee breaks and perhaps some extras. As Lyon is 
 really central (direct trains from Charles de Gaulle, VERY close to 
 the center of gravity of the Council). The overall budget should be on 
 the lower side of the spectrum.


Answers to question raised by the council:
 


* What is the average cost for a meeting?
	+ Daniel should answer this.
* How does this address the goals and priorities identified earlier?
	+ Address the priority to be reactive and decisive with respect to our 
	 user community. Two meetings a year warrants that the ensuing releases 
	 fully cover user's requests for evolution of the guidelines. It also 
	 provides a may to create a real shared view on the TEI technical 
	 orientations and priorities which in turn can be easily disseminated 
	 to the community by council members'
* Why couldn't the same intense level of work be accomplished via 
 teleconference?
	+ Because we cannot go deep into the principles and only tackle surface 
	 issues. Telcos and Videos are often a procrastination tool for too 
	 complex issues.
* Would it be more cost effective for the Board to spend money on 
 videoconferencing capabilities?
	+ That would not improve the human aspects while resulting on probably 
	 more technical problems when setting up such environments.
* What is a minimum host contribution?
	+ Should not be set in advance, but basically: free rooms, coffee 
	 breaks, one dinner and inviting 2 members of the council as speakers.


Whatever the decision of the board, we should put as a priority to 
 have this peripatetic nature of the council be integrated in 
 forthcoming grant proposals.
