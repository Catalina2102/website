* 18:35\-20:15 Conference and Members' Meeting Debriefing
In this section of the meeting, we will examine trends, themes and
 observations that arose during the course of the meeting. Were there
 any specific themes that developed in the course of the meeting?
 Papers or conversations that suggested interesting directions or
 plans we should consider? Aspects of the conference and meeting
 itself that should be retained, modified, or abandoned?
* 20:15\-21:15 Planning the 2011 (and 2012?) Meeting
We had a number of suggestions about planning the 2011 (and further)
 meetings. We should use the end of tonight's meeting to decide on

 Sunday, November 15, 0900\-1600 CEST (PDS\-2\)
 
 * 0900\-1015 Bylaws.
We need to decide whether we wish to act on the proposed bylaws on
 behalf of the membership. The proposed bylaws are [here](/Board/2010BylawsProposal.xml). There relevant section on amendments can be found
 [here](/About/bylaws.xml#TEIby-A7). If we decide to amend the bylaws, we must make some
 changes: the proposed bylaws would reduce the size of the board to 6
 for one year. Changes in the minimum (7\) and maximum (10\) size of
 the board requires approval of the membership.

If we decide to alter the bylaws, we need to plan the transition.
 This means, amongst other things, planning special elections.
* 1045\-11:15 Committees and Officers
	+ Election/Confirmation of Officers (incumbents in brackets;

	 or all of these positions now, or decide to defer or delegate
	 some of these decisions.
