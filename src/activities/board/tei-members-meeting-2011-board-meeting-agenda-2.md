John Unsworth



 Proposed Agenda
 
 
 Monday, January 10, 2012
 
 I. Annual Members Meeting * 
II. Authorizing expenses for TEI Council meetings (Ann Arbor,
 Oxford)* 
III. Election questions and our response to the answers* Questions:[http://www.tei\-c.org/Membership/Meetings/2011/mm54\.xml\#body.1\_div.4](/Membership/Meetings/2011/mm54.xml#body.1_div.4)



Responses: [http://www.tei‚Äêc.org/Membership/Meetings/2011/mm57\.xml](/Membership/Meetings/2011/mm57.xml))
 from Chair's report at the 2011 Members' Meeting in Frankfurt.


In most cases, the direction suggested by the candidates is something
 that can be accomplished (e.g. not merging Board and Council;
 continuing to collect fees; introduce some kind of individual
 participation). In other cases, action may not be in precisely the
 form described in questions, but in keeping with the basic
 underlying premise (e.g. moving towards P6, encouraging examples or
 tools, etc.)
IV. Google and TEI * What do we need to be doing to strengthen this connection? Can we
 play a role in funneling TEI output for Google Books into the
 HathiTrust Research Center?

V. TEI for Dummies* How can the Board encourage wide adoption of TEI in the
 future?
