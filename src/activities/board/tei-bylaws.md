# TEI Bylaws




Preamble for the 2010 Proposed Revisions
 
 
The following proposals to the Bylaws of the TEI are presented by the Board of
 Directors to the membership for approval. The principles embodied in these
 changes were approved in an email vote by the Board on September 25th after
 extensive discussion. The precise language was approved by the board on Thursday,
 October 7, 2010\.


With the exception of some minor housecleaning, the major focus of the revisions
 are on the composition of the board and the relationship of host institutions to
 the consortium. In particular:


* the number of elected members of the board (i.e. members elected by
 the Consortium membership) is increased (after a transition period) from
 the current 4 to 8 members
* The limit on host representation to the board is removed (it is
 currently a maximum of 4\)
* The right to vote on decisions of the board is reserved solely for
 elected members of the board.





The bylaws presented here are those proposed at the time of incorporation and
 subsequently revised by the TEI Board. They may be revised further by the TEI
 Board, as described [herein](#TEIby-A7). The bylaws specify
 different [classes of membership](#TEIby-A1), and other details
 of the organizational structure of the Consortium, such as its [Board of Directors](#TEIby-A4) and [Committees](#TEIby-A6). For full details, please consult the table of contents
 for this section.



 Article I. Members
 
 
 1\. Members.
 
 Classes of Members* Institutions, consortia, organizations, projects and companies can
 be members of the TEI\-C. There shall be one class of members. Each
 member shall be entitled to one vote for each director position to
 be elected and for any other vote requiring the vote of the members,
 as specified in Article II, section 3 of these bylaws. Members will
 have the right, also, to propose officially sanctioned TEI\-C
 training and services, with such agreements screened by the TEI\-C
 Council and approved, ultimately, by the TEI\-C Board of
 Directors.
Subscribers and Sponsors* In addition to members, the TEI\-C shall have subscribers and
 sponsors. Subscribers and sponsors will pay dues and will enjoy many
 of the benefits that members enjoy, but they will not vote.
Application* Any organization eligible to become a member (and any individual
 or organization eligible to become a subscriber or sponsor) of the
 TEI\-C may apply by submitting an application, in form prescribed by
 the Board of Directors, along with any dues or filing fees required
 to be submitted with an application, to the Secretary of the TEI\-C.
 If the Secretary finds that such applicant has complied with all
 requirements in connection with the application, the Secretary shall
 add the applicant's name to the list of members (or subscribers or
 sponsors).
Dues, Etc* Members (and subscribers and sponsors) shall pay dues (and such
 other charges and assessments as are established by the Board of
 Directors) in such amounts and at such intervals as determined by
 the Board of Directors from time to time. The Directors may
 establish differences among members (or subscribers or sponsors)
 with respect to the amount or timing of dues or other charges or
 assessments. Notice of any dues increase approved by the Board of
 Directors shall be provided to members, subscribers and sponsors at
 least 60 days prior to the annual billing date for dues. No member
 (or subscriber or sponsor) shall be entitled to a refund of any dues
 or other charges or assessments upon resignation or
 termination.
Special Categories* The Board may from time to time establish special categories to
 recognize outstanding contributions by members. The development of
 tools that further the use of TEI, for example, may entitle a member
 to be designated as a TEI Developer or other title which, in the
 discretion of the Board, appropriately reflects such member's
 contribution.




 2\. Membership Requirements.
 
  The Board may establish such attendance and other requirements as it
 deems proper.




 3\. Duration.
 
  Each member may hold membership as long as such member remains qualified
 for membership, except that membership may be sooner terminated by
 suspension or expulsion as provided in Section ~~3~~[4](#TEIby-A1.4) of this Article or by
 resignation as provided in Section ~~4~~[5](#TEIby-A1.5) of this Article
 Corrects
 incorrect reference..




 4\. Termination. 
 
  The Board of Directors may terminate a membership (or subscribership or
 sponsorship) in the TEI\-C upon a good\-faith finding of (a) misconduct by
 such member (or subscriber or sponsor) reflecting discredit upon the
 TEI\-C or (b) violation of these bylaws (including but not limited to the
 nonpayment of dues or other required charges or assessments).




 5\. Resignation. 
 
 Any member (or subscriber or sponsor) may resign from the Consortium by
 delivering written notice of resignation to the Secretary. Such
 resignation shall be effective upon the Secretary's receipt of such
 written notice.





 Article II: Meetings of Members
 
 
 1\. Meetings.
 
  Meetings of the members shall be held not less than once a year, on such
 dates and at such places as the Board of Directors may designate from
 time to time. The first meeting after December 31st shall be designated
 as the annual meeting. At the annual meeting, the Chair shall report on
 the operation of the TEI\-C for the preceding year and announce the
 results of the election of the Board of Directors. 
 The notice of
 each annual meeting shall include ~~a~~an electronic
 ballot or proxy for the election of the members of the
 Board and such other matters as may require the vote of the
 membership. ~~The~~ If a proxy if provided, such
 proxies shall be returned to the Secretary~~, either in
 person, dispatched by major courier service guaranteed for
 delivery in three days or less, electronically mailed, or mailed
 by first class (domestic) or airmail (international) post,
 postage\-prepaid. The Secretary will tabulate the results of the
 matters on which a vote is taken. To be included in the
 tabulation of the vote, a proxy must be received~~ by the
 time designated in the material sent with the notice of meeting.
 
 The Secretary will tabulate the results of the matters on
 which a vote is taken. The final vote will be presented to
 the members at its annual meeting by the Secretary either in person
 or by certificate delivered to the Chair of the TEI\-C. ~~The vote
 by proxy for the election of the Board shall be final. As to
 matters other than the election of the Board, the votes for and
 against each item by proxy will be presented at the annual
 meeting and provisions made for those present to participate in
 a discussion and vote on such items, changing the earlier vote
 by proxy if desired.~~
This section of the bylaws, which pertains to the general operation of meetings, was
 incorrectly found in the following section on special meetings. Additional changes
 add specific language pertaining to electronic ballots and remove unnecessary specifications
 (regarding mode of postage, etc.)





 2\. Special Meetings.
 
 A special meeting of members may be called by the Board of Directors in
 its discretion or upon written request to the Secretary by one\-third or
 more of members of the TEI\-C entitled to vote. No business other than
 that specified in the notice of the meeting shall be transacted at any
 special meeting of the members. ~~The notice of each annual meeting
 shall include a proxy for the election of the members of the Board
 and such other matters as may require the vote of the membership.
 The proxies shall be returned to the Secretary~~, either in
 person, dispatched by major courier service guaranteed for
 delivery in three days or less, electronically mailed, or mailed
 by first class (domestic) or airmail (international) post,
 postage\-prepaid. The Secretary will tabulate the results of the
 matters on which a vote is taken. To be included in the
 tabulation of the vote, a proxy must be received~~ by the
 time designated in the material sent with the notice of meeting.
 
 The Secretary will tabulate the results of the matters on
 which a vote is taken. The final vote will be presented to
 the members at its annual meeting by the Secretary either in person
 or by certificate delivered to the Chair of the TEI\-C. The vote by
 proxy for the election of the Board shall be final. As to matters
 other than the election of the Board, the votes for and against each
 item by proxy will be presented at the annual meeting and provisions
 made for those present to participate in a discussion and vote on
 such items, changing the earlier vote by proxy if desired.~~This section more properly belongs in the previous section.





 3\. Voting.
 
  At meetings of the members, members shall be entitled to voting rights
 as provided in Article I of these bylaws. Upon application for
 membership, it is the responsibility of each member to designate an
 elector empowered to cast votes for that member: only designated
 electors will be permitted to vote. In the event that a member wishes to
 change its designated elector, the original applicant for that member
 organization must deliver written notice to the Secretary of the TEI\-C,
 identifying (with full contact information) both the original elector
 and the new elector, and stating that electoral rights should be
 transferred from the former to the latter. Such notice shall be given
 not less than fourteen (14\) days before the date of the first meeting in
 which the member wishes its new elector to be entitled to vote. Notice
 shall be deemed duly given when it has been either delivered in person,
 dispatched by major courier service guaranteed for delivery in three
 days or less, electronically mailed, or mailed by first class (domestic)
 or airmail (international) post, postage\-prepaid, to the address of the
 Secretary of the TEI\-C, as it appears on the TEI\-C web site. In the
 event that a member has not designated an elector at least fourteen (14\)
 days before a meeting, the member's vote cannot be cast at that
 meeting.




 4\. Notice of Meetings. 
 
 Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting, and, in
 the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
 meeting is called shall be given not less than twenty\-one (21\) days nor
 more than sixty (60\) days before the date of the meeting (except as
 otherwise required by law) by or at the direction of the Chair or the
 Secretary, or the persons calling the meeting, to each member entitled
 to vote. A notice shall be deemed duly given to a member when it is
 either delivered in person, dispatched by major courier service
 guaranteed for delivery in three days or less, electronically mailed, or
 mailed by first class (domestic) or airmail (international) post,
 postage\-prepaid, to the address of such member as it appears on the
 records of the TEI\-C.




 5\. Quorum.
 
 
~~A q~~Quorum 
 on votes taken at any meeting
 of the members, whether annual, regular, or special, shall exist if at
 least one\-third of the members entitled to vote are present in person or
 by proxy
 , or have received an electronic ballot. The vote of
 a majority of the members entitled to vote ~~that are present in
 person or by proxy~~ at a meeting at which a quorum is present
 shall be necessary and sufficient for the adoption of any matter voted
 upon by the members, unless a greater vote of the members is required by
 law or these bylaws. 
 In the event quorum is not achieved at a
 meeting of the membership, the issue in question shall pass to the
 Board for resolution.
Adds explicit discussion of electronic balloting, cleans up some aspects of the quorum
 rules (e.g. that it pertains to individual votes, rather than presence at meetings),
 and adds provisions for handling a failure to achieve quorum.






 Article III: Officers
 
 
 1\. Selection of Officers.
 
  The officers of the TEI\-C shall be elected by the Board of Directors and
 shall consist of a Chair, a Vice\-Chair, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and a
 Council Chair. The Board of Directors may also
 ~~select~~appoint
Stylistic change. additional officers as it deems
 necessary or appropriate from time to time. The officers of the TEI\-C
 shall have the respective powers set forth herein and as otherwise
 provided by resolution of the Board of Directors. ~~With the possible
 exception of the Treasurer and Council Chair, each officer of the
 TEI\-C shall be selected from among the Board of Directors.~~With the new distinction between elected (voting) and appointed (non\-voting) Directors,
 there is less need to insist that officers be drawn from the board. Our experience
 with the new position of the board\-level Council chair suggests it can be useful to
 have the option of bringing in outside expertise.
 Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the power to set salaries
 and fees of employees and independent contractors shall reside in the
 Board of Directors and not in any officer or officers.




 2\. Chair.
 
 The Chair shall be the chief executive officer of the TEI\-C and shall,
 subject to the direction of the Board of Directors, generally supervise
 and manage the affairs of the TEI\-C. In general, the Chair shall perform
 all duties customary to the office of Chair, shall see that all orders
 and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried out, and shall
 oversee the other officers in the discharge of their duties. The Chair
 shall, if present, preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and
 of the members.




 3\. Vice\-chair.
 
  In the absence of the Chair, the Vice\-chair shall carry out the Chair's
 duties at meetings. In the event the position of Chair becomes vacant,
 the Vice\-chair shall carry out the Chair's duties as set forth in
 Section 2, above, until the Board elects or appoints a successor
 Chair.




 4\. Secretary. 
 
 The Secretary shall keep the minutes of all meetings of the members and
 of the Board of Directors, shall serve all notices, shall present all
 pertinent communications before the proper committees, shall be
 custodian of the records, shall attest the seal of the TEI\-C on all
 contracts and agreements required by law to be under seal as authorized
 by the Board of Directors, shall conduct the correspondence incident to
 this office and shall perform such other duties as the Board of
 Directors may require.




 5\. Treasurer. 
 
 The Treasurer shall collect, have custody of and be responsible for all
 funds of the TEI\-C, shall keep an accurate account of such funds, shall
 pay all just bills when due and funds are available, and shall submit a
 financial report as of the end of each fiscal year (December 31st) at
 the annual meeting. All checks, drafts, notices and orders for the
 payment of money issued by the TEI\-C and other similar documents
 requiring the signature of the TEI\-C shall be signed by the Treasurer or
 by such other person or persons, if any, as the Board of Directors may
 from time to time designate. ~~In the event that the Treasurer is not
 selected from among the Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall
 become a member of the Board.~~This clause is no longer necessary because of the changes to the first article in
 the section.





 6\. Council Chair. 
 
  A Chair shall be appointed by the Board to direct the business of the
  [Council](#TEIby-A6.2) and be responsible
 ultimately to the Board for activities of the Council and its
 workgroups, including the maintenance and development of the Guidelines.
 ~~In the event that the Council Chair is not selected from among
 the Board of Directors, the Council Chair shall become a member of
 the Board.~~This clause is no longer necessary because of the changes to the first article in
 the section.






 Article IV: Board of Directors
 
 
 1\. Directors. 
 
 
~~The Board of Directors shall initially consist of a minimum of
 seven (7\) Directors and a maximum of nine (9\), and thereafter may be
 increased or decreased within the foregoing range from time to time
 by a majority vote of the Board of Directors then in office, or by
 members. Four of the Directors will be representatives of the TEI
 Hosts: in the event that the TEI\-C has more than four Hosts, the
 Hosts will choose their representatives to the Board by simple
 majority vote among themselves. Other Directors will normally be
 elected by the members, except during the first two years of the
 TEI\-C, when the three scholarly societies that originally sponsored
 development of the TEI (the Association for Literary and Linguistic
 Computing, the Association for Computers and the Humanities, and the
 Association for Computational Linguistics) will each have the option
 to appoint a representative to the Board of Directors. In the event
 that the appointive option of any of the Hosts or the original
 sponsoring societies is not exercised, the resulting vacancy on the
 Board shall be filled by a vote of members in normal or special
 elections.~~
The Board of Directors shall consist of three classes of members,
 elected, appointed, and host representatives. After a transition
 year in which the number of elected members shall be increased to 6
 by special election, the elected membership of the board shall
 consist of 8 members, chosen by the membership as described in
 Article [II](#TEIby-A2). Additional members,
 officers, and observers may be appointed by the board as necessary
 for the efficient conduct of its business. In addition, all host
 institutions (see [Article VI.3](#TEIby-A6.3))
 shall have the right to designate a representative to the board to
 assist and advise in its deliberations and decisions. Only board
 members elected by the membership as described in Article [II](#TEIby-A2) shall be eligible to vote in Board
 decisions.
Replaces language describing the implementation of the original board with language
 describing the new board structure.



Individuals need not be TEI\-C sponsors or subscribers or constituents of
 TEI\-C members in order to be nominated and elected to serve on the Board
 of Directors. The minimum and maximum numbers of 
 elected
 Directors may be changed, either to different minimum and/or maximum
 numbers or to a single fixed number, only by the members. No decrease in
 the number of 
 elected Directors shall affect the tenure of
 any incumbent Director. Any vacancy 
 among the elected membership of
 the Board~~in a Director position resulting from the
 increase in the number of Directors shall be filled by the members,
 in normal or special elections. Vacancies in a Director position
 resulting from other causes~~ shall be filled by the vote of
 members in normal or special elections.
 Brings language into line with new structure of the Board.





 2\. Term ~~and Class~~.
 
  Each ~~Director~~elected Directors of the Board shall be
 elected for a term of two (2\) years, or in the case of election to fill
 a vacancy between regular elections, for the term remaining for such
 vacant position, except as provided in Section 1, above. ~~The Board
 of Directors shall consist of two classes of Directors (appointed
 and elected) with each class being as nearly equal to the other
 class as possible.~~Brings language into line with new structure of the Board.





 3\. Elections. 
 
 At each annual meeting the members will elect members to any of the
 elected positions on the Board of Directors due to be vacated. Terms of
 office begin at the following January 1st. Elected Directors will serve
 a two\-year term ending on December 31\. In the election of Directors each
 elected Director position shall be voted on as a separate matter with
 each member entitled to vote receiving one vote for each Director
 position.




 4\. Meetings. 
 
 Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at such time and
 place as the Board of Directors may by resolution designate. Directors
 may attend Board meetings by telephonic or other two\-way connection
 provided that the Director(s) not physically present can hear, and be
 heard by, all those participating in such meeting, and a Director so
 participating shall be deemed present for quorum purposes. One of such
 meetings, as close in time as may be practicable to the annual meeting
 of the members, shall be designated by the Board as the annual meeting
 of the Board. Special meetings may be called by the Chair or any
 combination of Directors constituting at least one\-third of the total
 number of Directors then in office. In the case of a special meeting of
 the Board of Directors, no business other than that specified in the
 notice of the meeting shall be transacted, unless all members of the
 Board are present at such meeting and consent to the transaction of such
 other business.




 5\. Quorum.
 
  A majority of the Directors shall constitute a quorum for the
 transaction of business. The act of the majority of the Directors
 present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of
 the Board of Directors, unless a greater vote of the Directors is
 required by law or these bylaws, or pursuant to the Members' Agreement.
 In lieu of action at a normal or special meeting, the Board may act
 pursuant to unanimous written consent signed by all Directors in one or
 more counterparts which together shall constitute a single instrument,
 and the Board may authorize, to the extent consistent with the laws of
 the Commonwealth of Virginia, the use of secure electronic signatures to
 sign such instruments if circulated by electronic mail.




 6\. Notice of Meetings. 
 
 Written notice of all meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
 required. Written notice shall be given at least seven (7\) days prior to
 regular meetings and at least fourteen (14\) days prior to special
 meetings. The notice shall state the date, time, and place of the
 meeting and the purpose thereof. A notice shall be deemed duly given
 when it is either delivered in person, dispatched by a major courier
 service guaranteeing delivery in three days or less, electronically
 mailed, or mailed by first class (domestic) or airmail (international)
 post, postage prepaid, to the address of such Directors as it appears on
 the records of the TEI\-C.





 Article V: Funds
 
 Funds for meeting the expenses of the TEI\-C may be provided in such manner as
 the Board of Directors may determine, including without limitation such
 annual or other periodic membership dues as may be fixed from time to time
 by the Board of Directors and specified in a Membership Agreement to be
 signed by each new member of the TEI\-C, and such charges for meetings,
 seminars, and publications as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of
 Directors. Charges other than for membership dues and assessments may be set
 on a per\-person basis or any other basis deemed appropriate by the Board of
 Directors.




 Article VI: Committees 
 
 
 1\. Committees. 
 
 Except as provided otherwise herein, the Board of Directors from time to
 time may appoint such committees as it deems necessary to carry out the
 purposes of the TEI\-C, including but not limited to any committees
 described in these bylaws. These committees shall be assigned the
 responsibilities described in these bylaws or specified by the Board of
 Directors and shall report to the Board of Directors and/or the members
 as required herein or by the Board of Directors.




 2\. TEI\-C Council.
 
 The Board of Directors shall establish a TEI\-C Council to superintend the
 technical work of the TEI\-C. The TEI\-C Council will consist of twelve
 members, who need not be TEI\-C sponsors or subscribers or constituents
 of TEI\-C members, and non\-voting staff and advisors, who may be
 appointed by the Council as needed to assist it in carrying out its
 tasks. The TEI\-C Council membership shall include the Chair of the
 Consortium and at least one other person designated by the Board of
 Directors. The Board shall also appoint the Chair of the Council. This
 Chair may be drawn from the Council's elected or appointed members.


Except as specified in these bylaws or as designated by the Board of
 Directors, TEI\-C Council members will be elected to two\-year terms by
 TEI\-C members, with nominations and service open to the general public;
 at each annual meeting the members will elect members to any of the
 elected positions on the TEI Council due to be vacated. Terms of office
 begin at the following January 1st. Elected Council members will serve a
 two\-year term ending on December 31\. In the election of Council members
 each elected Council position shall be voted on as a separate matter
 with each member entitled to vote receiving one vote for each Council
 position.


The work of the TEI\-C Council will be to collect, propose, evaluate, and
 implement editorial changes to the TEI Guidelines (and its derivatives),
 to produce up\-to\-date documentation for the TEI, propose and assist in
 the preparation of training documents and tutorials, evaluate agreements
 for official TEI\-C training, services, and collaborations and make
 recommendations to the TEI\-C Board concerning endorsement of such
 training, services, and collaborations.


The TEI\-C Council may delegate any of these functions to appointed
 working groups or committees, at its discretion. The TEI\-C Council will
 also have the power to create working groups or appoint non\-voting staff
 and advisors with a fixed term and a specific charter. Funding for
 Council workgroups or non\-voting staff and advisors (if required) must
 be approved by the Board in advance of the appointment.The TEI\-C Council
 may convene upon call of the Chair or at the request of a majority of
 the Board. A majority of the members of the TEI\-C Council shall
 constitute a quorum.




 3\. TEI\-C Hosts.
 
  Upon incorporation, the first four TEI\-C Hosts shall be Brown University
 (the Scholarly Technology Group), the University of Virginia (the
 Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities and the Electronic
 Text Center), Oxford University (The Research Technologies
 Service), and The University of Bergen,
 represented by
 the
 Department of Culture, Language, and Information technology, each of
 whom shall serve a four\-year term. Thereafter, the Board of Directors
 shall select ~~a minimum of four~~ TEI\-C Hosts, using a public
 Request for Proposals process. Hosts may be re\-appointed for second and
 subsequent terms, but they must participate in the RFP process. ~~In
 the event that a Host representative vacates one of the four Host
 seats on the TEI\-C Board and there are at that time more than four
 Hosts, the remaining Hosts shall collectively select the replacement
 Board member. In the event that there are fewer than four Hosts, the
 seat on the Board shall be empty until filled by the normal Host
 selection process.~~ In selecting Hosts, the Board of Directors
 shall respect those fundamental principles of the TEI\-C calling for
 international and interdisciplinary representation. Hosts must be
 members of the TEI\-C. Hosts shall serve for a minimum four\-year term,
 and shall agree, in addition to a membership fee, to provide support
 services for the TEI\-C and to organize, convene, or assist in TEI\-C
 meetings. Hosts may also assist the TEI\-C in recruiting members, raising
 endowment, providing training or consulting to members, and
 disseminating information and tools relevant to the use of TEI.
 
 Each host may also designate a representative to advice the board of
 directors and participate in its deliberations. Host representatives
 may be drawn from the elected membership of the board as described
 in [Article IV.1](#TEIby-A4.1) or appointed to the
 board by the host. In keeping with [Article
 IV.1](#TEIby-A4.1), host representatives who are not drawn from the
 elected membership of the board may not vote in Board
 decisions.
Changes here bring text in line with new Board structure and eliminate restrictions
 on minimum and maximum number of hosts.





 4\. Nominating Committee.
 
  Not less than three months prior to the notice date for each annual
 meeting of the members, the Board of Directors shall appoint a
 Nominating Committee consisting of two (2\) or more of the Directors, one
 of whom the Board shall designate as the Chair of the Nominating
 Committee. The Nominating Committee shall solicit members and others for
 nominees, and those nominating such candidates shall provide the
 Nominating Committee with written confirmation that each candidate, if
 elected, is willing to serve. Such candidates shall then be included on
 the slate of candidates proposed by the Nominating Committee. The
 Nominating Committee shall propose one or more candidates for each
 Director and Council position to be elected pursuant to proxy sent to
 all members in connection with the notice of the annual meeting. The
 slate of candidates proposed by the Nominating Committee shall be
 contained in the notice of such meeting. In addition, the Nominating
 Committee shall prepare the slate of officers to be presented at the
 annual meeting of the Board of Directors, soliciting Board members and
 others, to the extent permitted in these bylaws, for such positions and
 securing written confirmation that each officer candidate, if elected,
 is willing to serve. This slate of proposed officers shall be contained
 in the notice of the annual meeting of Directors. Except as otherwise
 provided in these bylaws, in the event of a vacancy on the Board of
 Directors or the Council, members shall, at a regular or special
 meeting, elect a replacement to serve the remaining term of such vacant
 position.





 Article VII: Amendments
 
 These bylaws may be repealed or amended or new bylaws adopted by affirmative
 vote of at least one\-half of the members of TEI\-C voting in person or by
 proxy at a regular or special meeting, or, to the extent permitted by law
 and not in conflict with the Articles of Incorporation, by a true majority
 of the Board of Directors then in office acting at a regular or special
 meeting, or by unanimous written consent of the Board. With respect to any
 meeting of members at which a Bylaw change is to be put to a vote, notice of
 such proposed change to the bylaws, including the text thereof, shall be
 included in the notice given for such meeting. With respect to any Board
 meeting at which a Bylaw change is to be put to a vote, notice of such
 proposed Bylaw change, including the text thereof, shall be given twenty\-one
 (21\) days before the date of such meeting, by any of the various means set
 forth in Article IV, above.
