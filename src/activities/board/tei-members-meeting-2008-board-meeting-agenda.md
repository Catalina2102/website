* 09:20 Chair's Introduction (DO)
* 09:30 Board Discussion and Brainstorming: Goals and Priorities (SS)
 
 For this block we will do some brainstorming on goals for the coming
 year and longer term. Board members will be asked to propose a range of
 specific or general results, activities, and goals. We will then as
 a group weigh the various options and look for patterns among the
 proposals that we can then weigh off against the available resources and
 where possible use to set our agenda for the coming year. In the final block
 we will weigh the implications of these various proposals for our resources
 and produce a final list for action.
 


Things to consider for this section include short\-term irritants, specific things
 
 you would like to see accomplished in the coming six months or year, and what you
 would like the TEI to be in course of the next five years.
* 11:00 Coffee
* 11:15 Reports (DP, VL, LR).
 
 Note: Since all of these were also discussed at the Members' Business meeting, the
 emphasis
 should be on highlighting things that should be drawn to the Board's attention.

	+ 12:10\-12:20 TEI Tite (DO)
* 12:20 Lunch
* 12:45 Board Discussion and Brainstorming: Processes (DO).
 
 For this block, we will discuss how we would like to organise our
 deliberations and action for the coming year and in the longer term. The
 TEI is a mature organisation of 20\+ years; the consortium in its current
 form is considerably younger (8\+ years) and is arguably changing from a
 new organisation to a mature one\-\-a change that may bring different challenges. In
 the last two years we have also made a number of important changes in
 organisation and focus. How should the board operate going forward? The
 immediate goal will be to come to an agreement on a set of working
 arrangements for balancing efficiency, transparency, and inclusiveness.
 But we may also develop larger scale ideas about the function of the
 board in the organisation.
 


Things to consider for this section include problems in our current organisation
 and operation; specific desires concerning how we should operate as a board (meet,
 construct committees, ensure appropriate transparency and effectiveness); and the
 goals
 we should set ourselves.
 


At the end of this block we should have reached a consensus on how and how often we
 want
 to meet as well as how we want to balance our deliberate vs. executive functions and
 how
 we want to deal with business we have previously assigned to 
 ad 
 hoc committees and officers such as Finance and Grants, and Membership and 
 Recruitment.
* 13:45 Coffee
* 14:00 Budget/Proposal Discussion and Evaluation (DO).
 
 Three requests to the TEI for new policies and programmes have been made
 by members/board members (to be circulated separately). In addition, our
 brainstorming about goals and priorities and processes will probably
 produce suggestions for new approaches or changes to old ones. And a
 changing economic climate means that we need to consider what prudent
 financial management means for the TEI for the coming year(s). In this
 section we will consider the various proposals present to us, looking
 for patterns, deciding which seem promising enough to consider further
 for inclusion in the 2009 or subsequent budgets, and which need to be
 put aside for now or rejected outright. Goal: approval in principle of a
 specific activities or events for inclusion in the 2009 budget. We will
 expect these items to be revised and edited in light of the actual
 resources available to us and board comments for final approval at a
 teleconference in early December.
* 16:00 Adjournment
