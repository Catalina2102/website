Background: I am the founder and the director of the Center for
 Open Electronic Publishing (Cléo, Marseilles, France). I am the founder of
 Revues.org. Revues.org is the longest standing platform for humanities and
 social sciences journals in France. More than 250 journals have already
 joined the platform in the domains of history, sociology, anthropology,
 geography, archaeology, political sciences, philosophy, literature, etc.
 While Revues.org was originally started to promote Francophone journals,
 today it aims to become an international platform with journals from any
 country and any language. I am also the founder of Calenda, the social
 science calendar, and Hypotheses.org, platform dedicated to scholarly
 blogging. I have created Lodel (a CMS dedicated to digital publishing) in
 2004\. Lodel 1\.0 will be the first CMS natively compliant with XML TEI,
 thanks to OpenText (doc/odt to TEI webservice created by Cléo). Around
 Revues.org platform, Hypotheses.org and Calenda, the Cléo has developed new
 tools to accompany the research and publishing processes at every stage,
 from managing ideas to research dissemination towards the academic community
 via selecting and publishing of texts.


 I was originally a historian of photography. I taught at Avignon University
 and the EHESS in Paris for several years before founding Cléo in 2007\. I am
 now involved in Digital Humanities. As the Cléo director, I am an
 "information system manager" for the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific
 Research). I have published a great many articles on digital history and
 digital publishing. I have published two books. I am the editor of
 Read/Write Book. Le livre inscriptible. I am the co\-author, with Pierre
 Mounier, of L’édition électronique (La Découverte, 2010\).



Candidate statement: My technical skills in TEI are very modest.
 My goal and my abilities are not technical, nor semantic, but I'm involved
 in making the TEI more widely used, and used in contexts where XML NLM and
 DocBooks are more presents. The problem with TEI is less and less technical,
 to my mind. The TEI needs to be included in a scalable technical ecosystem.
 I'm not interested in manual encoding but in automated encoding, in order to
 implement TEI workflows in large platforms, deeply concerned with cost
 issues. Otherwise, for the publishing industry, semantics needs are often
 less important than visual needs.


 As a conclusion, my concerns are : scalability, costs and rendering. 




 Tomaž Erjavec

Background: Tomaž Erjavec works at the Dept. for Knowledge
 Technologies at the Jožef Stefan Institute in Slovenia. My main interests
 are in the development of annotated language resources (corpora, lexica,
 dictionaries, books), both from a language technology and digital library
 perspective, and preferably the combination of the two. Most of my work is
 in research projects but I am also an assistant professor at the University
 of Ljubljana and am involved in teaching at several universities. Home page:
 <http://nl.ijs.si/et/>


 I've been working with TEI for almost 15 years now, and the language
 resources that I helped in producing are TEI encoded (c.f. <http://nl.ijs.si/>). Maybe the most
 influential efforts in the area of language technologies have been
 MULTEXT\-East linage resources and the JRC\-ACQUIS parallel corpus. I have
 also been active in the area of digital humanities, partially through
 enabling the production of various TEI\-encoded resources (e.g. the eZISS
 digital library, Slovenian biographical lexicon, etc.) but also through
 teaching: I regularly teach TEI courses at University of Graz, have
 introduced TEI in courses taught at University of Ljubljana and Nova Gorica
 and in the scope of several ESSLLI summer schools; most recently I gave a
 course on TEI at the Computational Linguistics Summer School 2010 at the
 University of Zadar. I have also been a member of the TEI Council in 2002\. 



Candidate statement: If elected to the TEI board of directors I
 would concentrate on the bringing the TEI closer to the language technology
 community, where there has recently been a movement toward TEI esp. in the
 scope of the CLARIN infrastructure, and in spreading TEI in the countries of
 Central and South\-Eastern Europe. As priorities I see making TEI better
 interoperable with other (language technology) standards, esp. those of ISO
 TC 37, and further efforts in localising the TEI Guidelines. 




 Paul Schaffner

I have worked with various flavors of TEI daily for more
 than fifteen years; trained perhaps sixty staff members
 over that time in its use; overseen the conversion of
 tens of thousands of books and more than a billion words
 of TEI\-encoded text; written numerous TEI modifications
 for disparate projects; and served a term on TEI Council.
 I run the e\-text production shop at the University
 of Michigan's Digital Library Production Service, where I managed the
 "American Verse" project (1999\), the conversion of the Middle English
 Dictionary and Compendium (1997\-2000\), etc., mostly involving
 either transcription of, or extraction from, printed sources. I have spent
 most of the past ten years (2000– ) managing the three Text Creation Partnership (TCP)
 projects (EEBO, ECCO, and Evans):
 amongst these texts appears nearly every oddity of language, genre and format (and
 therefore every challenge to text
 encoding) that early modern authors and printers
 could devise.


“Managing” TCP means daily engagement with issues of capture and markup
 (I am responsible for most of our schemas, their customization, and their
 documentation); with workflow and metadata management; with vendor
 contracts, vendor keying guidelines, and vendor relations; and with training: I led
 several intro\-to\-TEI workshops this
 fall, with more to follow, but also daily supervise a staff of about 16 markup editors
 distributed amongst five centers in
 three countries; indirectly also the thousands of taggers and keyers employed by conversion
 firms who do the initial
 markup, trying hopefully to keep them all more or less consistent. On the technical
 front, at least, I am still a TEI
 novice, and the constraints of the projects I manage have only reinforced my native
 inclination toward simplicity,
 transparency, flexibility, and pragmatism. My real affection is less for the TEI mechanisms
 and more for the material and
 the information that can be captured from and about it; my academic training was mostly
 textual, linguistic, and
 historical, devoted to medieval and early modern languages, literatures, manuscripts
 and books.


Though much of my experience has been either with (historical and
 corpus\-based) lexicography or with library\-based bulk digitization
 and e\-publishing, and though I would indeed regard myself as representing those interests
 on the Board, I have no
 particular or partisan agenda. I am conscious of the poles between which TEI has always
 hung in tension: between minimal
 and full representation; between centralized standardization and localized customization;
 between backwards compatibility
 and innovation; and between ease of use and sophisticated application\-\-all of which
 must continue to be honoured. But I am
 even more acutely aware of the threats to TEI, chiefly the threat of insularity and
 irrelevance. This is a disease for
 which there is perhaps no cure (we all face it!), but mitigation can be found, as
 many open\-source projects have found, in
 openness: openness to development based on a community of practice, and awareness
 of changes in perceived needs both within
 and without the present community. It is a good thing to champion TEI as an approved
 standard; but a Pyrrhic victory to
 gain official approval without
 also making TEI a first resort: a tool fitted to the hand, and fit
 for the needs, of real users.




 John Walsh
 
 Website: [http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/spotlight/index.php?facid\=72](http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/spotlight/index.php?facid=72)


I am an Assistant Professor of Library and Information Science at
 Indiana University\-Bloomington, where I teach and conduct research in
 the areas of digital humanities and digital libraries. I am also the
 technical editor of Digital Humanities Quarterly and a member of the
 Executive Committee of the Association for Computers and the
 Humanities.


I have been a user of TEI and active in the community for over fifteen
 years. From 2005\-2008—the years leading up to the release of TEI P5—I
 served on the TEI's Technical Committee, and I have a strong technical
 and theoretical grounding in TEI and related technologies. My various
 professional roles have included programmer, project manager,
 librarian, and professor, and so I believe I am able to represent the
 concerns and interests of a broad range of TEI constituents.


The TEI has a long and distinguished history, and in recent years
 there have been many particularly positive developments: the release
 and ongoing development of TEI P5, the transformation of the members
 meeting into an academic conference, the expanding role and growing
 number of SIGs, and the support of important outreach activities.


If elected to the TEI Board, I would work to continue and strengthen
 these recent developments which have reenergized the always energetic
 TEI community. As the digital humanities more broadly continue to gain
 wider recognition in the academic community, TEI can take advantage of
 this moment to reaffirm its central role in digital scholarship—in
 the creation, preservation, analysis, and understanding of documents
 digital and otherwise.
