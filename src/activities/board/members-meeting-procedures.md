# Members Meeting Procedures





 
 Overall rationale
 
 
 This is a meeting for TEI members and subscribers, at which non\-members, prospective
 members, and the interested public are welcome.


TEI members and subscribers attend for free.


Members of the host institution attend for free (but do not become TEI subscribers).
 The host institution should be a member of the TEI. \[If it is not, it may join at
 the lowest rate?]


Invited speakers attend for free (i.e. their registration is paid by the TEI and they
 become subscribers for the remainder of that calendar year). 


Others pay a registration fee equivalent to one year's TEI subscribership. This makes
 them a subscriber for the remainder of that calendar year.


All events are open to anyone who is registered (i.e. TEI members, subscribers, speakers,
 those who pay registration fee, and members of local host institution).




 
 Venue
 
 
 
 In each case below, a minimum and an ideal specification is provided. The minimum
 is the basics necessary to run the meeting. The ideal is additional; the TEI usually
 should not pay for these extras, but if the local host can provide them for free,
 or if fundraising can cover them, they are highly desirable. 


Rooms needed
 
 
 * minimum: one large room for two days, to seat entire meeting group (\~75\-100 people);
 four small rooms on the second day for SIGs (\~10 people each); one large open room
 on second day for poster/demo session; one small meeting room on the third day for
 board meeting (\~15 people); space for coffee breaks.
* ideal: one large room for two days, to seat entire meeting group (\~75\-100 people);
 six or more small rooms on the second day for SIGs; one large open room on second
 day for poster/demo session which is the same as or near to the space for coffee breaks


Equipment needed
 
 
 * minimum: data projector in main room; internet access in main room; power for a dozen
 computers in poster session room; whiteboard or equivalent in smaller meeting rooms
* ideal: the above plus internet access in poster session room, data projectors and
 internet in smaller meeting rooms


Food needed 
 
 
 * Coffee breaks: there should be morning and afternoon coffee breaks each day, and also
 coffee available at the start of each day unless there is coffee available for purchase
 very nearby
* Lunch: typically lunch is not provided unless no adequate eating options are available
 within easy walking distance.
* Reception: there should be a reception at the end of the first day; it will typically
 be sponsored by a vendor or by some other organization who receives publicity in exchange



 
 Funding expectations
 
 
 Ideally, the local organizer's bid to host the meeting should include provision of
 funding for equipment, rooms, and coffee breaks. If funding can be provided to support
 speaker travel costs, that is even better. 





 
 Timetable
 
 
 \[these dates are just for the sake of argument]


March of previous year: Issue request for bids


June of previous year: Bid deadline


July 1 of previous year: Decision/notification deadline


July of previous year: Form program committee and change list subscriptions


Immediately following notification, begin plans for fundraising


Fall of previous year: Speaker invitations (is it desirable to announce speakers for
 next meeting at the annual meeting? perhaps not)


At annual meeting of previous year: announce location (but probably not dates, since
 our competitor conferences haven't set theirs yet by this time)


Shortly after the annual meeting of the previous year, announce dates (as a followup)


By January of the meeting year, should know who the invited speakers will be


March of the meeting year: Prod the SIG chairs to find out who will meet


Spring of meeting year: Reservations and logistical firming up


By May 1 of meeting year: Notification of TEI community re: location, date, registration
 details (and also post information at TEI web site) to allow for travel planning and
 funding by attendees


July 1 of meeting year: Registration opens (announcement of program, etc.)


August 1, September 1: Several more announcements and reminders...




 
 Planning logistics
 
 
 
 
 Registration method
 
 
 The registration method used thus far has been email. Attendees register by sending
 email to membership@tei\-c.org, with their name and institutional affiliation. Institutional
 members may send multiple representatives without a registration fee (this is easier
 to administer, and more of a membership benefit, than limiting the number of representatives
 who may attend from a single institution). Non\-members pay a registration fee, which
 may be paid on arrival. Typically the registration fee is set to equal the individual
 subscriber fee for a single year. 



 It would be ideal if a database could be set up to handle registrations, so that attendees
 could register via a web interface. This would be more convenient and would have the
 added advantage that it would allow us to do better tracking of attendance, geography,
 and other factors, and also to maintain contact with attendees following the meeting.
 




 
 Hotel information
 
 
 The local organizer should if possible negotiate discounted rates at a local hotel.
 Hotel information is provided well in advance of the meeting. Members make their own
 reservations. 




 
 Information
 
 
 A web page with the meeting location, date, and instructions for registration should
 go up as soon as the venue is announced.


Travel details (shuttle service, map, location of event) should go up as soon as available
 and not later than two months before the meeting.





 
 Meeting logistics
 
 
 Before the meeting, the executive director should prepare the following (or see that
 this is done):


* print name tags for all attendees and invited speakers
* print checklist of attendees, members, subscribers, electors (one copy for admin use)
* print program and business meeting agenda (sufficient copies for all attendees)
* print ballots for election (sufficient copies for all electors)


Logistics of registration
 
 
 * a table is needed outside the meeting venue
* check off names as people arrive, hand out name tags
* accept payment from non\-members and non\-subscribers (we need to consult with Daniel
 concerning whether such payments should be considered subscription fees\-\-in which
 case the TEI should take receipt of them somehow and we need to know what method is
 convenient\-\-or whether they should be considered conference registration fees\-\-in
 which case there might instead be a place for them in the meeting budget)



 
 Logistics of the poster session
 
 
 
 The poster session should be held in a room which allows for at least twelve (and
 preferably more) poster or demo presentations can be set up, with room for circulation.
 



 It is best if the poster/demo session can be held in a location near where the meeting
 sessions are taking place, where materials can be set up in advance and left in place
 for several days; this allows for longer viewing of the posters. Ideally, the location
 would be close to the area for coffee breaks (or even in the same location) so that
 people can view posters during the breaks.



 Minimum equipment: tables or easels on which to display materials


Ideal equipment
 
 
 * easels for display of posters
* tables for laptops
* power and internet connectivity


Logistics of the SIGs 
 
 
 * equipment (minimum, ideal, optional/special requests)
* timing and duration (when they should typically be scheduled and how long they should
 typically be given)
* SIG reports


 
 Logistics of the business meeting
 
 
 The business meeting traditionally occupies the afternoon of the second day (from
 2:00 pm till 5:00 pm). It includes several required activities and several optional
 activities. 


The required activities are:


* certification of meeting
* designation of a minute\-taker
* affirmation of non\-payment of officers
* treasurer's report
* chair's report
* council report
* elections)


The optional events traditionally have included:


* SIG reports (held during the counting of votes)
* one other report or presentation during vote\-counting


There is also latitude to include additional optional events as may be determined.



 Logistics of the election are described separately (see TEI web site).







 Materials needed for the election:


* name tags
* checklist of attendees
* checklist of members
* checklist of electors





 
 Funding and Sponsorship
 
 
 Because the TEI does not have a large budget for this event, we seek various kinds
 of support, including institutional support from the host, grant funding, and sponsorship
 from vendors and other organizations. 



 Institutional support


As part of the local organizer's bid to hold the meeting, some commitment of institutional
 support is desirable (and is taken into account in evaluating the bid). Institutional
 support may include free meeting rooms, provision of equipment (projectors, computers
 for demonstrations, wireless connectivity), coffee breaks, receptions, funding for
 speaker travel.



 Grant funding


The TEI and the local organizer should seek sources of grant funding to cover the
 expenses of the meeting, particularly speaker travel funding and the cost of room
 rental and catering. If funding can be found to support the travel costs of the TEI
 board members, that is also very desirable.



 Sponsorship


Sponsorship from vendors, organizations, and other entities is welcomed, in the following
 forms:


* support for receptions
* provision of equipment (e.g. support for the poster/demonstration session)
* funding for speaker travel


Sponsorship will be acknowledged at the meeting. At an event for which sponsorship
 is provided, the sponsor may distribute brochures and other materials, and may provide
 display materials (e.g. posters, signs). Product demonstrations and presentations
 of a commercial nature are strongly discouraged. Vendors may be invited to give presentations
 as part of the TEI meeting, but these presentations should be intellectual in content
 and relevant to the topic of the meeting, and should not constitute a sales presentation.
 Vendors may be invited to give demonstrations as part of the poster/demonstration
 session, at the discretion of the program committee. The product or service should
 be relevant to the content of the meeting.




 
 
 Appendix: Call for Bids 
 
 
 The request for bids (revised version from last year below for critique; more work
 is needed on this)



 Call for Bids: TEI Members Meeting, 2006


Deadline: August 1, 2005



 The annual TEI Members' Meeting takes place every year in October or


November. We are now seeking bids to host this event in 2006\.



 The meeting this year (2005\) will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria on October 28\-29\.
 The previous meetings have


been:



 Baltimore, USA, October 22–23, 2004, hosted by Johns Hopkins University

 The meeting is a two\-day event, with approximately 70\-100 attendees. The first day
 is an eclectic mix of presentations and discussions from invited speakers and participants.
 The second day includes meetings of the TEI Special Interest Groups, a poster session
 and tools demonstration. The TEI business meeting is held on the afternoon of the
 second day, with reports on the TEI's work and the annual elections for the TEI Board
 and Council. 



 The TEI Consortium has a budget to cover the direct costs in connection with the meeting,
 but TEI is an organisation with limited financial resources, and any contribution
 from the host is very welcome.



 Bids should be sent to info@tei\-c.org by August 1, 2005, and should include the following
 information:



 The name of the institution(s) making the bid


The name, address, email, and telephone number of the contact person


A brief description of the facilities available for the event (rooms, equipment, technical
 support, food)


An indication of what financial support, if any, the hosting institution is prepared
 to give (for instance, sponsoring a reception or a pre\-meeting workshop; payment of
 travel expenses for a plenary speaker; etc.)


Any other details that may be useful in assessing the bid (e.g. the presence of a
 conference on a related topic at the institution around the time of the meeting; the
 launch of a new TEI\-related initiative at the institution, etc.).



 All bids will be reviewed by the TEI board, which makes the final decision. Bids will
 be assessed on the basis of a number of factors including level of support offered,
 location, ...\[more]
