# TEI Board Conference Call: 26 March 2008







TEI Board Conference Call: 26 Mar 2008

Chris Ruotolo


Certification of the meeting* The meeting was certified at \~16:00 GMT, with the following members present:
 John Lavagnino (JL), Daniel O'Donnell (DO), Sebastian Rahtz (SR), Laurent
 Romary (LR), Chris Ruotolo (CR), and Susan Schreibman (SS).
Digital Humanities session at DH 2008* Will hold discussion for next Council meeting.
Review of minutes from previous meeting* The minutes from the last conference call were approved.
LR's proposal for Council and editorial support group at Oxford* LR restated his proposal for an editorial support group at Oxford, which would manage
 releases of the Guidelines, maintain software
 (Roma), and maintain development servers. Total time commitment would be about .2
 FTE. The TEI would reimburse
 Oxford $20K per annum. The work would also account for Oxford's in\-kind host
 contribution. LR recommended that the Board enthusiastically support this
 proposal as an important piece of TEI maintenance. 


The Board discussed concerns that this arrangement would result in
 over\-centralization. The new Council structure and expanded role of the
 Chair was implemented in part to ensure that decisions about changes to the
 Guidelines are properly debated and aired. Actual management of the TEI
 source is in SourceForge, with multiple committers, and LR can easily
 redistribute responsibilities if necessary. The editorial support group at
 Oxford will be analogous to the financial support currently housed at
 Virginia, in that it could move to another institution at some point in the future.
 LR
 argued that we should view this as decentralization \-\- identifying places
 where there's a critical mass of competence for specific activities. The
 expanded role we envision for the SIGs in developing the Guidelines is also
 part of this decentralization.


The Board voted unanimously to approve the editorial support group at Oxford
 for a two\-year term, subject to confirmation from DP that the necessary
 funds are available.
Adjournment* The meeting adjourned at 16:33 GMT.
