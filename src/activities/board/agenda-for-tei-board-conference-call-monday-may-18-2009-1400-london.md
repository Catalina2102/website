 Appendices
 
 
 Chair's Report
 
 Another active quarter for the TEI. Most activity has been shared with Board
 by email as it has occurred, and other activities will are reported here.
 But some highlights: 


* TEI\-Mellon Grant: After some very valuable input from our last
 meeting, especially from Julia, who rewrote and reorganised the
 document, the RFP was issued last week. I've already received a
 half\-dozen emails on the matter from vendors and others, so it looks
 like things are going well.
* TEI grants: Experimental programme successfully completed (see
 [report](#grants))
* Council Meeting/TEI Day: Very successful Council Meeting and TEI
 day in Lyon this past April
* SIG Manuscript meeting: Grant funded meeting just finished in
 Paris
* Conference: Purchased Conftool instance; Call for papers just
 over




 Credit Cards
 
 Accepting Credit Cards has been a long\-standing desideratum of the TEI. Over
 the last 6 months, I have been investigating various methods of adding this
 capability to our operations. As a result of this investigation, I would
 like to propose that we open an on\-line webstore using the open\-source
 Zencart shopping cart software. We would use this software for subscriber
 and member enrolment, selling copies of the print guidelines, and conference
 registration. In the future, this software might also prove useful as a
 means of supporting the TEI\-Mellon digitisation members benefit, creating a
 market for independent vendors to sell support and consultation, and selling
 more ephemeral items like TEI branded clothing or accessories.


Hosting the Zencart software would require us to purchase independent
 hosting, as University of Virginia rules prohibit us running a commercial
 store from their server. As part of this proposal, we would also need to
 arrange for a merchant account (the account that allows us to receive money
 from customers via the credit card companies), a SSL certificate for the
 webstore, and the services of a credit card gateway (the companies that
 actually handle the credit card processing and security). Depending on the
 vendors and service packages chosen, the necessary services and software
 would cost us between $250 and $500 per year plus fees for individual
 transactions (usually $0\.25 \+ 2% per transaction). In the first year, some
 additional set\-up charges would apply bringing the total to between $450 and
 $700 for the first year plus per\-transaction fees.


I have investigated purchasing shopping cart services from vendors rather
 than running a cart ourself. As a rule, however, this approach reduces our
 flexibility without particularly diminishing the effort required to run the
 store. Most vendors tend to specialise in one type of shopping cart:
 software, conference registration, etc. In addition, most offer self\-service
 cart design and maintenance: the customer is expected to learn how to enter
 new items in the catalogue and develop any custom demands for "look and
 feel" themselves. The main advantage of contracting with a vendor for
 shopping cart services seems to be that the vendor arranges for the hosting,
 merchant bank account, and credit card gateway services. These are set\-up
 issues, however, and of relatively minor concern for an organisation like
 the TEI which might expect to run a webstore for several years using the
 same merchant bank, host, and gateway. For us, the far more serious issue is
 the time involved in day\-to\-day maintenance of the store\-\-an area where
 there seems to be little difference between running our own store and
 purchasing a service from a vendor.


The cheapest possible hosting for a Zencart\-based store seems to run at about
 $6/month. For this we would receive a working Zencart installation and
 standard hosting services (backups, email addresses, a domain name, etc). An
 alternative is to host with a site specialising in supporting Zencart
 installations. These are more expensive (ranging from about $12\-$25/month)
 but offer much better customer support. In each case this fee includes
 custom installation and software support (moving our installation from the
 test server to the production site and ensuring upgrades are made) and
 possibility of getting specialised and knowledgeable technical support for
 our day\-to\-day running of the store. One provider I spoke to was even
 willing to contract for the actual day\-to\-day operations\-\-adding new items
 to the store and/or providing phone\-support.




 Conference Fees
 
 At our December meeting, we discussed the possibility of charging more
 consequently for the conference. An amount mentioned at the meeting was $90
 with significant discounts for members, subscribers, and students. The
 rationale for this figure was: a) that it was in keeping with registration
 fees charged at similar conferences; and b) that $90 was unlikely to be much
 of a disincentive to participants when compared to the cost of travel,
 lodging, and meals for the trip.


After discussing the matter with previous and the current organising
 committees, I would like to propose the following fee schedule, to be
 implemented with the 2009 conference: 


* Retail (non\-discounted) rate: $90\.00
* Discounted rate (Subscribers, students, local participants):
 $45\.00
* Local students: $0


Since, at 120 participants, the TEI's current contribution breaks down to
 $43\.34 per person, this new structure would generally allow us to earn back
 our contribution to the conference, even if all attendance was discounted.
 This frees up $5200 for other purposes. By setting the retail price at $90,
 moreover, we allow ourselves the opportunity of realising a profit on the
 participation on non\-member/subscribers and offering our subscribers a
 relatively high\-dollar\-value benefit.


This model also allows us to address a problem that became apparent last
 year: in addition to the TEI's contribution of $5200, local organisers are
 expected to raise another $3500\-4500 in sponsorship and institutional
 contributions. As the conference has become more popular, however, it has
 become clear that this model discourages local hosts from maximising
 enrolment: because the TEI's contribution is fixed, every registrant
 represents a net loss to the local organisers since the increase needs to be
 covered out of the fundraising and institutional contribution. By pricing
 the conference on a cost\-recovery basis, the TEI eliminates much of this
 disincentive, since each registrant funds most or all of the cost of his or
 her attendance.




 SIG Grants
 
 I have nothing but praise for the way in which the SIG Grant Competition ran
 this year. The version of the text that the SIG Grant Committee drew up (and
 which the Board approved) resulted in three strong proposals. The proposals
 were modest enough for us to make awards to each of the three requests, as
 all three were deemed fundable by the Committee. Moreover, the variety of
 grant activities requested were diverse (two events and a request for
 student support).


The Committeeâ€™s adjudication process went smoothly and a decision was reached
 within 10 days. All three of the recipients were delighted with the grants
 received. My thanks to the Committee, Christian Wittern (Board Rep), and
 James Cummings and David Sewell (Board Reps) for their professional and
 punctual contribution to the process.


I would strongly recommend that we continue these grants, albeit with
 additional funding. If the Board could allocate between $10,000\-15,000 to
 this activity it would be ideal. I suspect that after this first round of
 grant announcements more SIG Chairs would be interested in submitting a
 proposal. It would be preferable for us to announce the Grant Call prior to
 the 2009 MM so that SIG Chairs could discuss possible projects at their
 business meetings.


The composition and size of the Board was ideal. Having both the Board and
 Council perspectives added to the process, and having only four people made
 discussion manageable.




 Nominations
 
 The nominations committee (Malte Rehbein, Julia Flanders and myself) has sent
 out the call for nominations about a week ago, with a deadline set for
 July1\. We already have two nominations sent to the new generic alias
 (nominations@tei\-c.org). Towards the end of the time period, I expect we
 will start to follow up on these and solicit more nominations if necessary.
 




 Publications
 
 Last year at the Board Meeting we discussed the possibility of a publishing
 arm of the TEI. I said I would raise this topic again in the spring. The
 impetus for this proposal came out of the desirability (or at least the
 perceived desirability) of publishing, at least, a proceedings from the
 Annual TEI MM and Conference.


In 2007 we were lucky in having L\&LC agree to publish a special issue
 of proceedings from the MM. In 2008 we were not able to secure a publisher.
 For 2009 I have had a discussion with the editors of a DH journal who are at
 least in principle, interested in publishing a proceedings.


It would, however, be more desirable (at least I think it would be) for the
 proceedings to be published by one publisher or at least to be co\-located
 online from one source (ideally the TEI site itself). While the TEI could
 simply choose to publish a proceedings on its site every year, this
 publishing model does not allow for contributors to get the necessary credit
 in terms of peer\-reviewed publication.


I should thus like to propose that we convene a committee to look into this
 matter, to report back to the Board sometime in the Autumn. A member of the
 Board should convene this committee (I would be happy to convene this
 committee, but if somebody else feels they would like to I would be happy to
 step aside!) and would suggest we have two representatives each from the
 Council and SIG Chairs.


If the Board agrees, a first step would be to draw up a terms of reference
 which I would suggest be done by two or three members of the Board. After
 this is agreed upon by the full Board, the Committee members be invited to
 serve, with a final report due to the Board prior to the 2009 MM.
