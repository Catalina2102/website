	+ July minutes to be approved in Graz
	+ Georg: approves
* Updates
	+ Election\-\-Pip
		- With many thanks to 2019 Nominating Committee, the election has been launched. TAPAS found their nominee, and Luis corrected the date for closing the election.
		- Should there be insufficient candidates for positions for TEI\-C, we would re\-open nominations. Such situations are avoidable when the committee encourages the community to participate in the process and indeed to stand when nominated. This is not the case for TAPAS, over whose governance TEI\-C has no authority.
		- The TEI is happy to offer TAPAS the infrastructure for nominations and elections. We encourage TAPAS to find sufficient candidates for their positions in time. This year, elections opened later than planned due to the lack of candidates for the TAPAS position delaying the opening of the TEI election. We would prefer to avoid this in future years.
	+ Conference\-\-Georg
		- All is in order; preparations are going well. The schedule has been revised. Some have withdrawn as unable to attend on dates presentations were scheduled.
		- Currently 70 registrations; still time.
		- Most importantly for the Program Committee and Board, chairs have not yet been assigned.
		- Only one submission so far for late\-breaking poster call.
		- Still missing six final versions of abstracts.
		- Board meeting has been rescheduled to Friday afternoon after the business meeting. Joint Board/Council meeting is scheduled for before the dinner on Monday.
		- The meeting information should be available in ConfTool.
	+ Journal\-\-Kathryn
		- Susanne Haaf is not able to take the duty at the current point of time, but would be willing to be approached later
		- Kathryn still to do follow up further on: 
			* list of attendees of the last 3 meetings
			* GV and KT to contact additional candidates by week of 12 August.
		- Anne is continuing her work through August and will get in contact with Joel Kalvesmaki in August. She is happy to meet with new managing editors in Graz.
	+ 2020 Conference in Lincoln, Nebraska\-\-Kathryn
