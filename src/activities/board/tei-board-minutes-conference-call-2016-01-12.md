 Minutes
 
 
 1\.0 MEETING PROCEDURE AND OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS
 
 The meeting was quorate. 


1\.1 PW volunteered to take the minutes. KT volunteered to check them.


1\.2 KT was welcomed to the Board. Board members introduced themselves and noted that
 MB, MD, and MM had one year left of their current terms. KT and PW have two\-year terms
 from January 2016\. JU’s non\-voting role was noted as essential to the TEI, and at
 Board
 meetings. MD and KT had already been in contact. MD, MM, and PW offered to help KT
 with
 any questions. MM suggested reading minutes of the Board and Council was an instructive
 way to learn about the community.


1\.3\. Anne Baillot’s acceptance of the role of Managing Editor for jTEI was welcomed.
 The Board congratulated her in absentia.




 2\.0 BOARD MEETING MINUTES: 
 1 November 2015: 
MD asked whether the Elections Committee described in the Guidelines was the same
 entity as the Nominating Committee described in the Bylaws
 ([http://www.tei\-c.org/About/bylaws.xml\#TEIby\-A3](/About/bylaws.xml#TEIby-A3)). MM agreed it was as there is nothing
 about an Elections Committee in the Bylaws and their duties were agreed to be the
 same.
 MD noted that as we reconsider the balloting process we should use the correct
 nomenclature.


MD checked whether Paul O’Shea (Social Media Officer)’s term is finished and a new
 Social Media Officer is to be recruited.


Action: MD to check the Social Media Officer’s term.


MD asked whether links were to be added to the detailed discussions and documents
 about
 new back office arrangements. It was agreed that there would not be links, as they
 might
 contain commercially sensitive information that is not the TEI’s property.


MD proposed approving the minutes with these changes. MM and PW supported the proposal
 and the minutes were approved.




 3\.0 ELECT OFFICERS
 
 MD introduced the election of officers and described the process involved. She noted
 in
 particular that the work of the Chair of the Board is not insignificant. She suggested
 that some of the roles, particularly that of Membership Secretary, could usefully
 be
 rethought, and that the Board and the TEI need committed individuals to get through
 the
 heavy workload ahead.


MD was willing to continue as Board Secretary and offer great support to the Chair.


PW suggested not giving major tasks to members new to the Board. KT was happy not
 to
 take on a major role. MD noted that as a newcomer she had volunteered to act as Board
 Secretary as a way of getting to understand the TEI and it had worked well.


MM commented that the role of Membership Secretary was key as the TEI’s long\-term
 future depends on signing up more institutional members at lower costs of between
 $250
 and $1,000 per annum. Through JU’s advocacy the TEI has done well recruiting individual
 members. There are about 250 memberships, which bring in about $12,000 per annum.
 MM has
 waited for TEI Simple’s completion and documentation online to use as part of a
 membership drive.


JU made a plea for help with membership and its transactions. His ability to continue
 as Treasurer is contingent on being supported in this. Treasurer’s duties include
 filing
 taxes, liaison with the accountant, and reimbursements. Undertaking invoicing as well
 is
 too much work for one volunteer. JU suggested a longer term appointee, like the
 Treasurer’s appointment, who would undertake the persistent tasks where members often
 ask for help. JU answered PW that the country of residence of this person is not
 important.


MD noted that to achieve this would require a change in the Bylaws.


Action: MD add this to the Board’s work.


Until the Bylaws can be considered and updated accordingly, MD suggested this is work
 the Membership Secretary could undertake. Her suggestion was agreed.


JU noted that he had hired a new accountant (and left the meeting at this point).


Action MD: ask JU what additional work the accountant can undertake: for
 example the tasks around membership and acting as official TEI address.


3\.1 CHAIR


KT nominated MD as Chair noting MD has gained useful experience as Vice\-Chair. MD
 noted
 she only has one year of her current term on the Board left, and accepted the
 nomination. MM and PW supported the proposal.


MD is Chair of the Board.


3\.2 SECRETARY


MD nominated KT as Secretary. KT accepted the nomination. MM and PW supported the
 proposal.


KT is Board Secretary.


3\.3 MEMBERSHIP SECRETARY


MD proposed MM continue as Membership Secretary. KT and PW supported the proposal.


MM is Membership Secretary.


3\.4 PROGRAMME CHAIR


MM suggested the Programme Chair for the TEI Members’ Meeting and Conference need
 not
 be a Board member. The Board’s responsibility would be to pick a suitable
 venue/institution. The local hosts could pick a Programme Chair, and invite members
 of
 the Technical Council onto the Programme Committee for guidance (see email archive).


Action all: to comment on this via email.


Action MB and PW: to revisit conference notes and guidelines.


MD followed up on a suggestion from the previous Board Meeting that a Conference Chair
 could be useful by suggesting that role could be undertaken by default by the Chair
 of
 the Board.


A decision on Programme Chair was postponed until the 2015 report can be
 considered.


Action PW: to write the Programme Chair’s conference report from 2015\. 




 4\.0 USING THE TEI\-C WIKI
 
 MD has created a communal space on the TEI\-C Wiki for use in Board work.


Action all: register to use Wiki, using this space to document work and set
 agendas.


MD offered help to anyone needing help using a Wiki.




 5\.0 REVIEW SELECT ACTION ITEMS FROM 
 01 NOVEMBER 2015
 BOARD MEETING
 
 
 MD reported that EP was dealing with some Action Items about the jTEI.


Action MD: to follow up EP’s Action Items with her.


5\.1\. MD is redrafting roles for existing offices, including Membership Secretary and
 the non\-voting Board member to support the Treasurer (see 3 above).


Action MD: to summarize the future work of the Board and outline how it
 will be achieved.


5\.2 MD is updating procedural documentation, and will ask EP, MM, and JU to share
 their
 great experience. PW is working on the TEI Members’ Meeting and Conference guidance
 (see
 Agenda item 3, Action Items 5 and 6 above); MB and Emmanuelle Morlock are revisiting
 this too (see Minutes of the previous meeting). MD requests that we do as much work
 as
 possible over email.


5\.3\. MD reported that JU will email about out\-sourcing back office work, with details
 of what the accountant can undertake on the TEI’s behalf. MD notes that JU cannot
 make
 the regular meeting time.


Action MD: to ask JU for a time he can join the meeting so we can benefit
 from his experience.


5\.4\. MM questioned what difference a Social Media Officer makes. PW and KT supported
 keeping the role. MD suggested we keep the role for at least another year, posting
 a
 position description to the TEI List and approaching likely individual members to
 encourage applications for the role.


Action PW: draft position description.


Paul O’Shea’s work in social media including hosting live chats, actively engaging
 in
 online conversation, curating established and emergent elements of the TEI community.
 was commended. It was agreed to seek evidence and make a judgment accordingly.


Action MD: to ask Paul O’Shea for a report on the impact of the Social
 Media Officer’s role, benchmarking studies, metrics, and archiving.


(see also Agenda item 2, Action Item 1 above).


5\.5\. MD noted work on the TEI website is much needed.


Action MD: to check on the Web Masters’ progress.


5\.6\. MD suggested publishing the Call to host MM2018 in early 2016, earlier than in
 previous years. No decision was made.




 6\.0 AGENDA SETTING FOR FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL
 
 
 Next tasks include revisiting the Bylaws and voting for amendments to them. MD noted
 we
 have enough Action Items to set the agenda for the coming months.


Action MD: to draw up a roadmap for the year. Action all: to comment on
 roadmap. MD will set agendas a few months before each meeting. Action MD: to work
 on
 agendas, outlining and prioritizing our work, accounting for dependencies.


MD will call for volunteers over email to take on particular pieces of work.
 Agenda\-discussion and \-setting will happen on the Wiki.


Action PW: to produce internationalization report.


Action MM: to produce a challenging report on the TEI, taking a zero\-base
 budget review to everything.


Action MD: to contact MB and check if the regular meeting time works for
 her.


Action MD: to find a meeting time with JU to discuss back\-office work
 further.




 7\.0 OTHER BUSINESS
 
 MD sought opinions on other options for virtual meetings, given the technical problems
 encountered this call, and the desirability of seeing each other. Skype and Google
 Hangouts were suggested.


Action MD: to investigate the viability of Skype and Google Hangouts.


Action PW: to send minutes to KT for checking, then to the Board for
 approval.


Action MD: to send her encoding template for Minutes to KT.


Minutes taken by PW. And encoded by KT.
