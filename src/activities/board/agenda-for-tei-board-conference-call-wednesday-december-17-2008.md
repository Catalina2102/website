# Agenda for TEI Board Conference Call: Wednesday December 17,                 2008







Community Outreach Coordinator

Daniel O'Donnell



Community Outreach Coordinator
 
 This proposal describes a coordinator position for the Community
 Outreach Program described in the accompanying proposal. Possible titles
 for this role might be something like "Community Technical Officer" or
 "Community Outreach Coordinator". In this proposal we will refer to this
 position as the COC.


 In this proposal we envision this as a volunteer position, on the theory
 that if the TEI chooses to fund this activity the money is better spent
 on grants to projects as described in the COP proposal. However, if the
 program overall is a success we may find that in a few years there is
 both need and funding to permit this to be a paid position. Some
 additional activities and responsibilities are described at the end that
 could be added if this role expands.


As currently envisioned the position is roughly at a part with the SIG
 Coordinator in its level of responsibility and time commitment. It might
 be desirable to appoint two co\-coordinators. The COC would be appointed
 by the TEI Board of Directors


The role of the COC is to coordinate the TEI's Community Outreach
 Program, to ensure that queries and requests for assistance are answered
 promptly and that members of the TEI community are able to get advice,
 consultation, and assistance in developing grant proposals.


 Specific responsibilities and activities include:
 


* maintaining a current set of consultant listings
* recruiting consultants who represent a broad range of expertise and a
 variety of languages so to support as much of the TEI community as possible
* publicizing the COP and its grants program
* serving as point of contact for queries about TEI consultancy, the
 outreach program, grant assistance
* issuing call for proposals for the consultancy grant program and
 managing whatever proposal review process is established
* once a year, compiling reports from grant program for the TEI to be
 shared at the TEI members meeting (and in whatever other venues are
 appropriate)
* help consultants and projects publish the results of their work
 (customizations, tools, etc.) on the TEI web site or wiki, as appropriate


If funding were available for this position, additional activities and
 responsibilities could include:
 
 


* providing basic consultation via email, answering questions that fall
 below the threshold for consultancy but above what respondents on e.g.
 the TEI list are likely to provide.
* ensuring that customizations and other TEI\-related tools, stylesheets,
 etc. arising out of TEI consultations are made available to the TEI
 community in a usable form.
* cultivating relationships with relevant disciplinary bodies to
 coordinate the development of appropriate customizations
* maintaining active contact with consultants (especially those
 providing support under the TEI consultancy grants program) and
 identifying projects whose outcomes include products (e.g.
 customizations, conversion stylesheets, tools, etc.) might be of benefit
 to the TEI community at large
* at the conclusion of a project, receiving these products and doing
 whatever is necessary to polish, document and publish them on the TEI
 site (e.g. providing explanatory material, checking for bugs, adding
 comments, etc.)
* curating this library of customizations (e.g. migrating them forward
 to future versions of the TEI as necessary)
