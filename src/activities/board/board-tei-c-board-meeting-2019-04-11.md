1\. Meeting Procedures and Other Announcements (Christiane)
-----------------------------------------------------------


The [March minutes](https://tei-c.org/board/board-tei-c-board-meeting-2019-03-14/) have been approved by Gimena, Kathryn and Christiane.
2\. Updates
-----------


### 2\.1 TEI Conference Graz 2019 (Georg, Gimena, Martina)


The conference organisation is moving along as planned. We have the usual challenges to get positive feedback from the people who has been asked to act as keynote speaker. We got no response or they are not available at the conference dates. Today we have only one submission in conftool. Deadline is 12 May 2019 23:59 CEST. Please announce the [Call for papers](https://graz-2019.tei-c.org/call-for-papers/) and document it in the announcement protocol.
### 2\.2 Nominations and Elections Committee (Pip)


The members of the nominations committee are set. These are Gimena del Rio Rande, Christiane Fritze, Hugh Cayless, Pip Wilcox, Scott Hamlin, Luis Meneses. The call for nominations well be send out by end of the month.
### 2\.3 Infrastructure Working Group (Martina, Luis)


The tei\-c.org domain is hosted by [network solutions](https://www.networksolutions.com/). John Unsworth is currently owner of the domain. Hugh initiated the domain transfer which caused some extra trouble on the part of the hosting institution. The moving to HumaNum is on the agenda of the next Infrastructure Working Group Meeting.
### 2\.4 JTEI (Kathryn)


The Board discussed advice from the General Editor and Managing Editor on the optimum make\-up of the editorial team going forward, and possibilities for remuneration or in\-kind compensation. After consideration, it was agreed that the increasing workload was unlikely to be sustainable for single editors. The Board's preferred route was for a team of up to 5 editors at any one time, at least one of whom would have some technical proficiency. This arrangement allows for contingencies with its built\-in redundancy, and for less experienced team members to learn on the job, becoming experts in their turn and sharing their knowledge with newcomers.
The last issue (no 10\) is published since 2016, these are the papers from the TEI Conference in 2015 in Lyon.


### 2\.5 FORCE11 (Kathryn, Gimena)


Gimena reports on the work of FORCE 11, a merely science driven initiative on scholarly communication, discussion,  publication and e\-scholarship. There could be arising some synergies for sustaining journals in the current context. The FORCE 11 Working group on data and metadata are interested to build bridges to the Humanities. Gimena also mentions the journal Revista de Humanidades Digitales and her experiences as a resource for the JTEI publication workflow.
3\. Any Other Business
A TEI introduction school will be held as a pre\-conference workshop to the TEI MM in Graz. Martina is asking whether the attendance of the pre\-workshop would allow for a reduced conference submission rate and whether a free TEI membership will be granted by attendance of a TEI event. Board approves if list of attendants can be handed in to Hugh early enough before registration.
Date of next Meeting
May 9 2019
