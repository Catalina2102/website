# TEI Board Conference Call: 8 February 2010

Certification of the meeting* The meeting was certified at \~13:00 UTC, with the following members present:
 Lou Burnard (LB), Julia Flanders (JF), Daniel O'Donnell (DO), Veronika Lux
 (VL), Daniel Pitti (DP), Laurent Romary (LR), Susan Schreibman (SS), Sarah
 Wells (SW) and Christian Wittern (CW).
Budget* A draft of the proposed 2010 TEI Board Budget was presented and discussed.
 The initial draft had a sizeable deficit, primarily due to reduced income
 from membership dues. Dues fell 15% from 2008 to 2009, and we can reasonably
 expect that the decline will continue in 2010\. The economic cutbacks that
 are prevalent in many universities are likely to continue, so it seems
 reasonable to prepare for continued reductions in membership and thus in
 income. 


DO gave an overview and explanation of costs broken down into two basic
 categories of Discretionary, Programme, and Administrative Expenses, and all
 other costs. Some costs are non\-negotiable and outside the Board’s control,
 such as insurance and tax preparation. Some costs are negotiable but are
 tied to essential programmatic or administrative work. There was prolonged
 discussion of these discretionary costs and how to best use the limited
 funds to fulfill TEI’s obligations to its membership. Primary candidates for
 cuts were administrative, membership, and editorial costs at Virginia,
 Nancy, and Oxford, and travel costs.


It was generally felt that administrative and membership costs are
 disproportionally high and that tasks such as credit card costs, membership
 invoices, and accounting could be streamlined by the implementation of a
 more efficient and centrally located database. This would require an
 investment of time by several people and therefore have upfront higher
 costs. While everyone agreed that this is necessary, it is not yet clear
 that the Board can or should allocate funds from an already anemic budget to
 this work this year.


Rather than making one or two drastic cuts, SS suggested a more general
 smaller cut to all administrative, membership, and editorial funding this
 year. However, the host institutions were also asked to submit a more
 detailed explanation of costs, so that the Board has a more complete picture
 of the work being done and the costs incurred at each institution.


The initial budget draft provided funding for two Council face\-to\-face
 meetings, one in Berlin in October and one at the Members Meeting in Croatia
 in November. It also allowed for one face\-to\-face Board meeting at the
 Members Meeting in Croatia in November. The Board discussed limiting funding
 to a single Council meeting and lowering the amounts available for travel at
 both meetings.


These two programmatic reductions would create a small surplus, which could
 be held in reserve for emergency travel costs, database development work,
 and any unforeseen costs. The Board asked SW and SS to draft a new version
 of the 2010 using the proposed cuts and to submit it to the Board. A
 second phone conference to review this draft willl be scheduled for as soon
 as possible.
