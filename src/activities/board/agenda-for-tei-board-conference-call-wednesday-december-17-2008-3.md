# Agenda for TEI Board Conference Call: Wednesday December 17, 2008 13:00 (British Standard Time)




 
 Daniel O'Donnnell
 
 Budget Meeting
--------------



### Comment



The goal of this meeting is to finalise the planned expenditures for our 2009 budget.
 There are a number of new requests for resources. These need to be considered in relation
 to
* Our estimated expenses and income for 2009\. This document is still in preparation.
 But it can be estimated from (see *Appendix A1: 2008 Revised Financial Statement (2008\-12\-09\)* ).
* The size of our cash\-reserve: DP has recommended that we keep a cushion of between
 $5\-$10K.
* A decision about how conservative we should be in the face of the current economic
 uncertainty℄Perhaps we should be more conservative in our cash reserves this year?
* Our strategic priorities



Because the goal of this meeting is to finalise planned expenses, and because there
 are a large number of proposals on the floor, I'd like us to concentrate particularly
 on financial questions. If a proposal has non\-financial questions that still need
 resolution, but can be accepted in principle for a specific amount, then I will ask
 us to move discussion of the non\-financial aspects off to the list or our next meeting
 (scheduled for February).
