# TEI Host Bids for 2005-2009





 
 Brown
 
 
 Brown University proposes to renew its TEI host status for a term
 of four years, from January 2005 through January 2009\. Within Brown,
 the primary locus of the host activities will continue to be the Women
 Writers Project, a long\-standing TEI project engaged in intensive
 research on text encoding of early printed books, currently producing
 TEI documentation under a grant from the US National Endowment for the
 Humanities. The WWP would host the TEI with collaboration and sharing
 of the host fee from the Center for Digital Initiatives at the Brown
 University Library, and possibly also from Brown's Scholarly
 Technology Group. All three groups share a strong interest in the TEI
 from varying perspectives, and are actively engaged in TEI research on
 topics including digital libraries and best practices, scholarly text
 archives, documenting TEI extensions, using TEI for web sites and
 small scholarly projects, developing TEI publication tools and
 systems, and exploring their use in scholarly research. Brown is also
 home to several other TEI\-related projects and projects which are
 considering using the TEI, including the Modernist Journals Project
 (<http://www.modjourn.brown.edu/>), MonArch (<http://dev.stg.brown.edu/projects/Monarch/>), and two epigraphy
 projects. In addition, the Women Writers Project has subsidized the
 North American Editors' work for the TEI (first Steve DeRose and more
 recently Syd Bauman) for four years and will continue to do so if our
 proposal is accepted.


The Brown staff who will provide effort to the TEI Consortium are:
 


* Julia Flanders: Julia Flanders is the Director of
 the Women Writers Project. She is also the Associate Director for
 Textbase Development at Brown's Scholarly Technology Group, and
 engages in consulting on TEI projects at STG. As a private consultant
 and through her work at the WWP, she regularly provides TEI training
 and consulting.
* Syd Bauman: Syd Bauman is a programmer/analyst at
 the Women Writers Project, where he sustains the WWP's encoding
 research effort and provides all technical implementation of the WWP's
 TEI work. He has served as North American Editor of the TEI Guidelines
 since January 2002, and before that served as interim editor.


In addition to Brown's $5000 cash host contribution, Brown will
 commit to the following in\-kind contributions:
 


* The WWP will contribute Julia Flanders' time to perform the duties of TEI Chair, 10%
 FTE for as long as she remains in that role.
* The WWP will contribute Syd Bauman's time to perform the duties
 of North American Editor at a level of 12% FTE, until any change is
 made to the level of payment or effort for the Editors, at which point
 this contribution can be adjusted or renegotiated.


In addition to these commitments, the WWP staff will continue to
 perform TEI training and publicity work, recruiting, and assistance
 with TEI grant proposal writing.




 
 Nancy
 
 
 
 This document presents a proposal from three key institutions (LORIA,
 ATILF and INIST) located in Nancy (France) to act jointly as a new
 European host for the TEI consortium. The three institutions combine
 wide ranging expertise in fields central to our vision of the TEI's
 mission. This vision is also presented here, since it underlies the
 specific technical and managerial proposals we put forward for
 consideration by the Consortium.
 



 
 
 Who we are 
 
 
 
 
 The proposed host would be coordinated by the Loria laboratory in
 conjunction with two complementary institutions, ATILF and INIST:
 together these institutions provide a coherent pool of expertise with
 well\-defined connexions to other institutions at national and
 international levels. Each has long\-standing experience in document
 management activities (spoken corpora, textual corpora, grey
 literature, dictionary, terminology, etc.) and related research
 (natural language processing, lexicology, linguistics, information
 extraction). They have also been involved in joint activities for many
 years, which ensures their capacity to act together in making this
 proposal.
 



 
 
 Loria (Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses Applications )
 
 
 
 
 LORIA (<http://www.loria.fr>) is one of the top four
 research laboratories in computer science in France, jointly funded by
 national research agencies CNRS, INRIA and by three Universities of
 Nancy. In addition to such topics as software engineering, image
 processing, and theoretical computing, the research conducted at Loria
 has always had a strong component relating to language and document
 processing and more particularly to natural language processing,
 speech processing. man\-machine dialogue, information extraction,
 graphics, and optical writing recognition.
 



 Loria has been involved in TEI related activities for many years and
 has progressively developed a strong expertise in this domain. Among
 those activities, we can mention just a few to illustrate our general
 interests:
 


* The Silfide project (1994\-1996\), an on\-line concordancing environment fully based
 on TEI encoded texts;
* The European Telri project which led to the production in 1998
 of a qTEI based corpus of 22 translation of Plato's Republic;
* The Asila project (2001\-2003\), which was an opportunity to
 compile several legacy corpus of transcribed oral dialogue
 coming from various French research laboratories;
* The Freebank project (2004\-), that aims to provide a free
 environment for depositing and accessing on\-line linguistic
 resources (e.g. annotated corpora).



 Since 2000, Loria has taken a leading position in international
 standardization, taking responsibility for coordination of ISO
 standard 16642 (Terminological Markup Framework), and also
 chairing ISO committee TC 37/SC 4 (Language Resource Management).
 



 Loria will contribute to TEI consortium activities by
 contributing its technical expertise in the domains of data
 modeling and corpus management. It will also act as the
 administrative centre for the three institutions.
 



 Loria will also work in close collaboration with the headquarters
 of INRIA to develop a general framework for using the TEI
 guideline as a basis for its annual scientific report.
 




 
 
 ATILF (Analyse et Traitement Informatisé de la Langue Française)
 
 
 
 
 ATILF (<http://www.atilf.fr>) is a joint research
 unit of CNRS and University Nancy 2 resulting from a merger
 between the CNRS National Institute for the French Language
 (Institut National de la Langue Française Ð INALF) and the
 Language, Discourse, Cognition (LANDISCO) Laboratory of
 University Nancy 2\. ATILF is administratively under the CNRS
 Humanities and Social Sciences Department and also acts as an
 interface with the Department of Science and Technology of
 Information and Communication. ATILF is a member of the CNRS \-
 Institut de Linguistique Française Federation and of the TEI
 consortium.
 



 The laboratory conducts researches along three main axes:
 


* History of Language: Research activities are based on the diachronic approach which
 is essential to language study (Middle and Renaissance French, Etymology and History
 of the Lexicon, Meta\-lexicology);
* Modern and Contemporary Languages: comparative approach to languages (Contrastive
 and multilingual studies, Dialectology and Regionalisms, Interface between grammar,
 semantics and discourse);
* Computerized Linguistics: definition, management and use of computerized linguistic
 resources in automated language processing (Development of computerized tools, databases
 and resources, linguistic resources and metadata, natural language processing).



 At a national level, ATILF is the reference platform of
 linguistic resources supported by the CNRS Humanities and Social
 Sciences Department. It maintains computerized dictionaries and
 encyclopedias (Trésor de la Langue Française, Dictionnaires de
 l'Académie française, Encyclopédie de Diderot et d'Alembert,
 historical dictionaries of the French language), textual
 databases (Frantext and tagged Frantext), grammatical tagger
 (WinBrill) and linguistic databases (Historical database of
 French vocabulary) represent the core of the resources
 distributed by the laboratory.
 



 As a major European resurce provider, ATILF will contribute to
 the TEI consortium real life use cases and the ability to
 evaluate new technical proposals. Its extensive experience
 includes both the management of legacy data and the creation of
 new textual or lexicographic data.
 




 
 
 INIST (Institut de l'Information Scientifique et Technique) 
 
 
 
 
 INIST is the CNRS national centre for scientific and technical
 information. It is a repository of large document collections
 available to the public through document delivery services. It
 also provides indexing services of literature in Science,
 Technology, Medicine, Humanities and Social Sciences designed to
 contribute to bibliographic databases, as well as information
 services available online or on a variety of electronic
 media. The document holdings at INIST cover the core
 international scientific and technical literature.
 



 In addition, INIST produces two bibliographic databases, FRANCIS
 and PASCAL, covering the core scientific and technical
 literature; PASCAL is a multidisciplinary, multilingual
 bibliographic database that covers the core world literature in
 Science, Technology and Medicine back to 1973; FRANCIS is a
 multidisciplinary, multilingual database that covers the
 Humanities and Social Sciences back to 1972\. INIST also produces
 the BHA database in partnership with the Getty Research
 Institute.
 



 INIST is gradually enhancing its functions from those of the
 traditional librarian towards those involved in the support of
 digital archives for grey literature (e.g. dissemination of
 digital PhD theses). It will thus complement the contributions
 made by other members of the Nancy Group in exploring the
 applicability of TEI to scientific publications and reports. Work
 will also we done on designing and testing a new terminology
 chapter for the TEI.
 





 
 
 Our vision for the TEI 
 
 
 
 
 We see the TEI community as a unique arena where people with
 potentially differing scientific and technical backgrounds can
 share their methods and experience in the domain of textual
 encoding and management. This community of experts has along the
 years learnt to share a common language, which in a way (as can be
 seen from the discussion on the TEI list) goes beyond the sole
 sharing of the TEI tagset. The TEI community has also shown along
 the years that it could be at the forefront of available
 technologies, by, on the one hand, making the good choices when
 adopting such standards as SGML right from its start, but also by
 contributing heavily to the evolution of such technologies
 (e.g. the influence of the TEI work on XML and related standards).
 



 As a consequence, our bid is based on the assumption that the TEI
 community should carry on attracting the best expertise and
 relating itself to the most advanced initiatives worldwide in
 order to keep this leading position on the technological scene. To
 this purpose, we center our bid on potential scientific and
 technical progress that can be made in close collaboration with
 other ongoing standardization efforts.
 




 
 
 Action lines as a TEI host 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Technical contributions 
 
 
 
 
 Grouping these three institutions corresponds to a wish to
 combine their respective expertise on order to be able to provide
 a strong technical contribution to the TEI activities. In
 particular, we want to take a leading role in the following
 activities:
 


* Experimenting the ODD platform to explore its various extensions mechanisms and contribute
 to their dissemination;
* Revising the transcription of speech, in order to add some essential descriptors which
 are currently obviously missing (e.g. related to the management of turns) and provide
 some more elaborate guidelines as to the representation of temporally synchronized
 events (e.g. to facilitate the mapping to other formats such as Annotation graphs,
 Transcriber, etc.);
* Designing a new chapter that would replace the outdated P4 Terminology chapter, in
 order to make it compliant to a) the ISO standard 16642 (Terminology Markup Framework)
 and b) with the TBX syntax recommended by LISA (Localization Industry Standard Association).
 This future chapter would only consider a core set of descriptors (aka data categories)
 as recommended by the TEI, and would make full use of the extension mechanisms provided
 by the ODD framework to allow users to describe more elaborate models;
* Validating, and possibly updating, the current P5 Print dictionary chapter, in close
 collaboration with dictionary projects worldwide (e.g. the Grimm dictionary in Trier).



 One of the important aspects of our technical involvement is to
 ensure that the TEI developments are closely related to other
 international initiatives, in the continuity of the links
 established with W3C work. More specifically, we want to achieve
 a close collaboration between the TEI and ISO committee TC 37 on
 the following topics:
 


* Ensure the synchronization between the work done in the SO working group and the LAF
 (linguistic annotation framework) project within IISO/TC 37/SC 4\. In particular, there
 is a need for the two resulting documents (future TEI chapter and ISO standard) to
 share, at least, the same pointing and linking mechanisms and, when possible, the
 same underlying syntax (e.g. TEI attributes);
* Carry on the joint TEI\-ISO work on feature structures, which is close to its termination
 for the FS representation part, by developing a joint proposal for FS declaration;
* Influence the on\-going work on lexical structures in ISO/TC 37/SC 4 (project LMF Ð
 lexical markup framework) so that the print dictionary chapter could be seen in the
 close future as an LMF application;
* Specify and implement the link between the TEI tagset and the ISO/TC 37 Data Category
 Registry so that the latter provides the semantics for language related descriptors
 used by the former;
* Confront the current TEI header with other metadata initiatives (IMDI, OLAC ISO/TC
 37/SC 4 ad hoc group on metadata description) in order to provide mappings from and
 to them, and possible some TEI extensions to incorporate part of their contributions
 (e.g. OLAC roles).



 To do so, we will suggest to organize (as we have done in the recent
 months) meetings at our premises, or more practically, at AFNOR (close
 to downtown Paris and CDG airport).
 




 
 
 Dissemination and managerial activities 
 
 
 
 
 Our application as TEI host is based on the idea that we can stand as
 a center of competence for TEI related activities at local, national
 and international (esp. European) levels. Indeed, we want to take
 actions to:
 


* Create a core group of local experts within our three institution, who can be at the
 root of new TEI related projects;
* Take the lead of some national initiatives in France to network the
 research team which are involve in corpus gathering or lexicon
 creation activities. This will be done through the organization of
 dissemination and teaching activities; work has started in this
 direction with the creation of two national interest groups on grey
 literature management and spoken corpus transcription.
* Network European centers of competence in the domain of digital
 linguistic resources to foster more competence sharing and,
 incidentally, attract more members to the TEI consortium.



 Specific actions will be taken to establish strong links with German
 sites which by represent the highest potential of TEI users in EU at
 present. The excellent feedback received recently (8\-9 Oct. 20004\)
 during a tutorial given by Lou Burnard and Laurent Romary at Würzburg
 seems to be a promising start for future collaborations.
 



 This activity will obviously comprise preparing and presenting
 tutorials.

 Oxford
 
 
 The 
 Research Technologies Services at Oxford
 University Computing Services offers to be a core host for the TEI
 Consortium for a period of 4 years (2005\-2009\). 


The key staff at Oxford who will provide services and support for
 the Consortium are:
 


Lou Burnard* Lou is Assistant Director of Oxford University
 Computing Services, and European Editor of the TEI Guidelines. He
 has been at the epicentre of TEI work since its inception, and has
 left his mark on almost everything the TEI has done. He undertakes
 regular consultancy and teaching about markup, especially in the
 area of corpus linguistics. Outside the TEI Consortium, he is
 curently concentrating on Xaira, a TEI\-XML text searching engine,
 designed for language corpora.
Sebastian Rahtz* Sebastian is Information Manager for OUCS,
 and manager of [OSS
 Watch](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk) (the JISC\-funded 
 Open Source Advisory
 Service). He has been involved with the TEI since 1999, when
 he instituted a conversion of the resources of OUCS to TEI XML
 markup. He took a major part in the conversion of the TEI to XML for
 P4, and leads the language redesign for TEI P5\. For OUCS, he
 maintains complex stylesheets and other tools for authoring local
 web sites in TEI.
Judy McAuliffe* Judy is administrator for the Research
 Technologies Services and has been preparing TEI accounts for the
 last 3 years


The RTS, under the leadership of Mike Fraser, combines an unusually
 broad range of expertise, involving most areas of text encoding,
 humanities computing, metadata and digital libraries as well as
 undertaking leading\-edge collaborative research in the application of
 IT to research support. Other relevant national facilities now hosted
 by the RTS include the Oxford Text Archive, the Humbul Humanities Hub
 and the OSS Watch Open Source Advisory Service. The RTS has a high
 national and international reputation and a successful track record in
 bidding for research contracts from the JISC and other funding
 bodies. It also welcomes visiting researchers and research
 partnerships. 


Since the start of the TEI Consortium, Oxford has maintained one of
 the two mirrored web sites for the Consortium. It currently hosts a
 Perforce repository for the TEI web site and its archive.


As part of their role as a TEI Host, staff at Oxford would expect
 to continue to
 


* Take a major part in TEI workgroups and committees
* Regularly teach text encoding using the TEI
* Provide TEI consultancy in the UK and Europe, in particular to
 those research communities with which we have close links
* Contribute to the development of an enhanced online presence for
 the TEI


 For our in kind contribution, we will be developing software
 and web services for the TEI; we expect the practical production aspects of P5
 to be a major activity during 2005\.
 
 
 

 
 Virginia
 
 
 The University of Virginia proposes to continue serve as a host of
 the TEI Consortium for a four year term. Virginia played a critical
 role in establishing the Consortium, largely through the efforts of
 John Unworth, then director of the Institute for Advanced Technology
 in the Humanities (IATH), but also with the assistance of staff in
 IATH and the Library. Over the course of the four years that Virginia
 has served as host, the use of TEI has continued to increase. It is
 being used for large scale production of electronic texts in the
 Library, and in a wide variety of humanities research projects, many
 of them generously funded through private foundations and government
 grants. A new unit, the Electronic Imprint of the University of
 Virginia Press, has expanded the local use of TEI into publishing.
 TEI plays a critical role in a wide variety of digital
 initiatives. The University thus remains firmly committed to assist in
 the long term maintenance and development of the standard.


The Library and IATH will share hosting duties. Both units will
 share evenly the $5000 annual membership dues and be jointly
 responsible for coordinating $5000 annual in\-kind contributions of
 staff time and support. Provided we continue to have a host
 representative on the Board, the host representative will rotate
 between the two units on a two\-year cycle. Beyond these arrangements,
 humanities researchers at Virginia associated with the Electronic
 Imprint, Rossetti Archive, the Virginia Center for Digital History,
 and the NINES project have all expressed interest in becoming more
 involved with the TEI and assisting in meeting the in\-kind
 contribution.


In partial fulfillment of our hosting responsibilities, Virginia
 proposes to assume responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the
 TEI Web site. Given the desire of the Board to redesign the Web Site,
 Virginia will initially analyze the existing Web Site, gather
 suggestions from the Board on desired revisions and extensions of
 content and functionality, and provide a detailed design proposal for
 consideration and discussion by the Board. Virginia will take full
 responsibility for implementing a design approved by the Board, and
 subsequently assume responsibility for maintaining the site for the
 duration of the host appointment. Virginia will continue to host the
 Council and Board listservs.


In addition to these two commitments, staff at Virginia will
 continue to assist in writing and developing grant proposals,
 particularly those targeted at U.S. foundations and funding agencies;
 recruiting new members; and serving as needed and appropriate on
 working groups and committees.
