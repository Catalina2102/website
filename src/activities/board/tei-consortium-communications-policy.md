# TEI Consortium Communications Policy





Purpose
 
 The Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI) is a not\-for\-profit
 membership organization, whose goals and missions are set out
 on its website at [http://www.tei\-c.org/About/mission.xml](/About/mission.xml). This
 document sets out the TEI's policies concerning all aspects of
 communication with both members of the Consortium and more
 generally with
 members of the TEI user community.


This document was approved by the Executive Board of the TEI in
 November 2012, and
 the policies described here are effective as of that date. 



Communications Policy
 
 To ensure accountability of its proceedings, and in line with appropriate Freedom
 of Information legislation, the TEI Board undertakes :
 


* to make available without formality to the public all official records of its
 deliberations and decisions published as Minutes, Working Papers, Reports etc.;
* to maintain and publish an up to date list of such documents;
* to ensure that all such documentation is published without undue delay : in principle
 immediately after the Board has adopted the document concerned, or within 10 days
 thereof;
* to maintain an Archive of all of
 its internal discussions.


As far as possible, all publications of the Board will be made
 freely available to the general public using the TEI website and
 other appropriate mechanisms to ensure their widest possible
 dissemination on a not\-for\-profit basis. A list of all such documents
 is also maintained and is freely available from [the Board area of the TEI website](/Board/). 


Two exceptions to this general policy are envisaged. Firstly, the
 internal discussion of the Board on its private mailing list and the
 version of same stored in the Board's Archive;
 secondly, material which the Board considers confidential for the specific
 reasons listed below. 


Access to the Board's internal Archive is restricted to Board members for a
 period of no more than five years from its first circulation, after
 which such material will either be destroyed, or added to a distinct
 Open Access part of the Archive (known informally as the Vault) at the
 discretion of the Board's Chair and Executive Secretary.


The internal discussions of the Board may include matters
 considered confidential, relating to such topics as 


* selection of individuals for office;
* evaluation and ranking or selection of
 organizations for partnership or awarding of contracts;
* matters of serious political or personal controversy.

In case of doubt, the Chair of the Board will determine whether a topic should be
 considered confidential, and may also mandate means to ensure that is dealt with in
 confidence, for example by setting up a private list for discussion. Such private
 lists
 will be typically set up for a specified period only and archived after conclusion
 of that
 time.
