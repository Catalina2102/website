# TEI Board Meeting 31 2008: Board Meeting Addendum: Strategic Travel






 Proposal for TEI Board /
 SIG Grants,
 By Susan Schreibman, SIG Coordinator
 
 
 Over the past few years the TEI Special Interest Groups have grown both in number
 and in the activities in which they are involved. The TEI currently has eight active
 SIGs:
 
 


* Correspondence
* Education
* Libraries
* Manuscripts
* Music
* Ontologies
* Text and Graphics
* Tools


 I should like to propose to the TEI Board that a grant fund be established for the
 SIGs. SIG chairs could put forth proposals on behalf of the SIGs for activities that
 would benefit the TEI, broadly speaking (SIG chairs do not necessarily have to be
 the originators of the grant, but they should be submitted via SIG Chairs so that
 only one proposal per SIG is submitted per funding round). Success will be measured
 by: 1\) the ability of the SIG to carry out the proposed activity, 2\) deliverables
 due by the date proposed; activity contributes to the promotion and development of
 the TEI. These grants potentially have quite a large outreach component for the TEI.
 They will be widely advertised on lists and will spur thinking/conversation/activity
 amongst the TEI \[SIG] community. These grants may also be thought of as seed money
 for the SIGs to apply for further grants from agencies other than the TEI. 


 This grant will help the SIGs by providing them with small amounts of funds to further
 their goals. The types and focus of grants may vary. For example, the Manuscript SIG
 might request funds to run a day meeting prior to the Digital Humanities Conference.
 The Education SIG might request funds to develop an online teaching module. The Correspondence
 SIG might request funds to meet to work on a proposal to suggest additional tags or
 a tag set for the Guidelines. 


These grants, in the first instance, would be modest, c $300\-$1,000\. Grant amounts
 would depend on the activity proposed, the merit of the proposal, and the number of
 grants applied for in a particular round. Grant applications will be reviewed by a
 committee composed of:
 


* Two Board Members
* Two Council Members
* Chaired by the SIG Coordinator


The competition will be held twice a year and advertised in January. Grant applications
 will be due 1 March and 1 June. Competitions will be adjudicated within four weeks.
 The first adjudication board will create the terms of reference for the grants with
 final approval by the Board. 


Amount Requested: $3,000\-$4,000 for the first round of grants.
