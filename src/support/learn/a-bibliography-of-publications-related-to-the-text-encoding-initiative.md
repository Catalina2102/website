About this reading list
-----------------------



The lists of readings in markup theory and the TEI now stored in [a TEI Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/42025/tei/items) is derived from work originally prepared by Susan Schreibman and Kevin S. Hawkins for the TEI Education Special Interest Group, recoded in TEI P5 by Sabine Krott and Eva Radermacher and then migrated to the group library of the [TEI Zotero group](http://www.zotero.org/groups/tei)Â by Caitlin Clayton. Contributions and corrections are welcomed by joining the Zotero group or by email to tei-bibliography@tei-c.org.
