# Learn the TEI



[Introducing the TEI Guidelines](/support/learn/introducing-the-guidelines/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 This introduction provides an overview of the TEI Guidelines, describing their purpose
 and overall design, and addressing basic concepts of validity and TEI conformance.
 
 
TEI Training Events
-------------------



 
 The TEI's [events calendar](http://members.tei-c.org/Events) lists training opportunities, many of which offer a discount for staff at TEI member
 institutions and for TEI subscribers..
 
 
[Teach Yourself TEI](https://www.tei-c.org/support/learn/teach-yourself-tei/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 Although the TEI itself does not currently maintain any tutorials for learning TEI,
 the TEI community has produced a wide range of materials including online tutorials,
 materials used in teaching TEI workshops (some of which are held on a regular basis),
 and project documentation. The TEI maintains a listing of these materials and welcomes
 additions.
 
 
[A Gentle Introduction to XML](../../release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 The *Gentle Introduction* is one of the most often cited sections of the TEI Guidelines and has proven its
 usefulness as an introduction to the essentials of XML markup. It defines and describes
 elements, attributes, entities, validity, well-formedness, schemas and DTDs. While
 it is necessarily somewhat technical in nature, it is written for a non-specialist
 audience and provides an essential background for understanding how encoding languages
 like the TEI work.
 
 
[Getting Started with P5 ODDs](https://www.tei-c.org/guidelines/customization/getting-started-with-p5-odds/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 The underlying expression of the TEI Guidelines is a document called an ODD (or One Document Does it all), so called because it constitutes a single source from which the P5 schemas, reference
 documentation, and Guidelines prose are derived. The ODD language (which is part of
 the TEI language itself) is also the language in which TEI customizations are written.
 This introduction to the ODD language provides an overview of the essential concepts
 and some detail on how to write TEI customizations in ODD. ODD customizations may
 also be created using the web-based [Roma](https://roma.tei-c.org) tool.
 
 
[Bibliography](https://www.tei-c.org/support/learn/a-bibliography-of-publications-related-to-the-text-encoding-initiative/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 This bibliography of publications relating to the TEI provides further reading on
 the background, context, theory, and practice of TEI encoding.
