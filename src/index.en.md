# Text Encoding Initiative

The TEI Consortium is a nonprofit membership organization composed of academic institutions, research projects, and individual scholars from around the world. We develop the Guidelines, which provide the infrastructure for developing machine-actionable cultural heritage texts. Since 1994, the TEI Guidelines have been widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars to present texts for online research, teaching, and preservation.
