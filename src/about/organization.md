# Organization
The TEI Consortium is organized as a non-profit membership consortium, whose members and subscribers are institutions such as universities, libraries, academic projects, research units, and individuals. The TEI's principles and governance are described in detail in its [charter](/about/charter) and [bylaws](/about/bylaws).


The Consortium is led by a [Board of Directors](/about/board), which provides strategic direction and fiscal oversight, organizes the TEI's main activities, and coordinates fundraising and member recruiting.


The technical direction of the TEI Consortium is guided by the [TEI Technical Council](/activities/Council/), an eleven-person body whose members are elected by the TEI membership. The TEI Technical Council commissions working groups to develop and revise specific portions of the TEI Guidelines and to undertake other aspects of the TEI's technical development. It also reviews the work of these groups and provides technical advice and expertise to support the ongoing development of the Guidelines.
