# Potential New Logos
The Consortium of the Text Encoding Initiative is considering switching to a new logo, as part of this we had the community feed into a non-binding poll. **The poll was open until 2023-06-12.**


We asked a couple of initial questions, then showed voters you some images and then asked for your first and second choices. You may vote for the same logo twice if you wish.

**The poll is no longer open.**

The [results of the TEI-C Logo poll](https://tei-c.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TEI_Logo_Consultation-–-Results.pdf) are available at: <https://tei-c.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TEI_Logo_Consultation-–-Results.pdf>
