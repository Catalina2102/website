# Charter




The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) is an international research
 effort established in 1987, intended to produce a community-based
 standard for encoding and interchange of texts. The original phase
 of this effort was supported by three of the most important
 scholarly associations in the field and by major funders in North
 America and Europe, and included scholars from all over the world
 and from nearly all the disciplines of the humanities. The TEI
 Guidelines and the SGML-based TEI DTD (Text Encoding Initiative
 Document Type Definition) are thus the result of the twentieth
 century's most important international standardisation effort
 for humanities-related data, and have gained wide acceptance within
 the humanities and beyond. In recognition of this, the TEI
 Consortium (TEI-C) has been established to maintain, develop, and
 further the use of the TEI standard.


The goals of the consortium are:
 
 


* To establish and maintain a home for the Text Encoding
 Initiative (TEI) in the form of a permanent organizational
 structure.
* To ensure the continued funding of TEI-C activities, for
 example: editorial maintenance and development of the TEI
 guidelines and associated schemas, training and outreach activities, and services
 to members.
* To create and maintain a governance structure with
 broad representation of TEI user-communities.


The fundamental principles on which the TEI-C is established are
 the following:
 


* The TEI guidelines, other documentation, and associated schemas should be free
 to users;
* Participation in TEI-C activities should be open (even to
 non-members) at all levels;
* The TEI-C should be internationally and interdisciplinarily
 representative;
* No role with respect to the TEI-C should be without term.
