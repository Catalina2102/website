The TEI was established in 1987 to develop, maintain, and promulgate hardware- and software-independent methods for encoding humanities data in electronic form. For over three decades the TEI has been extraordinarily successful at achieving its objective and it is now widely used by scholarly projects and libraries around the world.


Although a comprehensive history of the TEI has not yet been written, all known
documentary resources about the TEI are stored in the  [Archive](/Vault/). If you (or others you know)
have electronic copies of any original TEI documents not available here, please [get in touch](mailto:web@tei-c.org).


The [archive](https://listserv.brown.edu/archives/tei-l.html) of the
[TEI-L discussion list](/Support/index.xml#tei-l) is a rich
resource for historical information, as is the archive of the now defunct TEI-TECH
mailing list, which can be [downloaded](/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tei-tech.tar.gz) in its
entirety.


Origins of the TEI
------------------



When the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was originally established, scholarly
projects and libraries attempting to take advantage of digital technology seemed
to be faced with an overwhelming obstacle to creating sustainable and shareable
archives and tools: the proliferating systems for representing textual material.
These systems seemed almost always to be incompatible, often poorly designed,
and multiplying at nearly the same rapid rate as the electronic text projects
themselves. This situation was inhibiting the development of the full potential
of computers to support humanistic inquiry by erecting barriers to access,
creating new problems for preservation, making the sharing of data (and
theories) difficult, and making the development of common tools impractical.


Part of the problem was simply a lack of opportunity for sustained communication
and coordination, but there were more systemic forces at work as well. Longevity
and re-usability were clearly not high on the priority lists of software vendors
and electronic publishers, and proprietary formats were often part of a business
strategy that might benefit a particular company, but at the expense of the
broader scholarly and cultural community. At the end of the eighties there was a
real concern that the entrepreneurial forces which (then as now) drive
information technology forward would impede such integration by the
proliferation of mutually incompatible technical standards.


In November 1987 a meeting at Vassar College was convened to address these
problems. Sponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities and
funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, it brought together a
diverse group of scholars from many different disciplines and representing
leading professional societies, libraries, archives, and projects in a number of
countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. At this meeting the [intellectual foundation](/Vault/ED/edp01.htm) for Text
Encoding Initiative was articulated. The organization of the actual work of
developing the TEI Guidelines was then undertaken by the three TEI sponsoring
organizations: The Association for Computers in the Humanities, the Association
for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and the Association for Computational
Linguistics. A Steering Committee was organized from representatives of the
sponsoring organizations, and an Advisory Board of delegates from various
professional societies was formed. To lead the actual work two editors were
chosen and four working committees appointed. By the end of 1989 well over 50
scholars were already directly involved and the size of the effort was growing
rapidly.


The initial phase resulted in the release of the first draft (known as "P1") of
the Guidelines in June 1990. A second phase, involving an additional 15 working
groups making revisions and extensions, immediately began and released its
results throughout 1990–1993. Then, after another round of revisions,
extensions, and supplements, the first official version of the Guidelines
(P3) was released in May 1994. Early on in this process
a number of leading humanities textbase projects adopted the Guidelines — while
they were still very much a moving target of rapidly changing drafts — as their
encoding scheme, identifying problems and needs and contributing proposed
solutions. In addition, workshops and seminars were conducted to introduce the
wider community to the Guidelines and ensure a steady source of experience to
support continuing development. As more scholars became acquainted with the
Guidelines, comments, corrections, and requests for extensions arrived from
around the world. In the end there were nearly 200 scholars from many
disciplines, professions, and countries in the core group that was developing
the TEI Guidelines.



The TEI Consortium
------------------



In January of 1999, the University of Virginia and the University of Bergen
(Norway) presented a proposal to the TEI Executive Committee for the creation of
an international membership organization, to be known as the TEI Consortium,
which would maintain, continue developing, and promote the TEI. This proposal
was accepted by the TEI Executive Committee, and shortly thereafter, Virginia
and Bergen added two other host institutions with longstanding ties to the TEI:
Brown University and Oxford University.


This group then formulated an [Agreement to Establish a Consortium for the Maintenance of the Text Encoding Initiative](/Vault/consortium.html) which was the basis on which a transition group comprising
representatives from the three original sponsoring organizations of the TEI, as
custodians of rights in the TEI, and from the incoming Host Organizations set
about the job of drafting and incorporating the TEI Consortium during 2000.


Incorporation was completed during December of 2000, and the first Board members
took office during January of 2001.


The goal of establishing the TEI Consortium was to maintain a permanent home for
the TEI as a democratically constituted, academically and economically
independent, self-sustaining, non-profit organization. In addition, the TEI
Consortium was intended to foster a broad-based user community with sustained
involvement in the future development and widespread use of the TEI Guidelines.
In both of these goals the creation of the Consortium has proven a positive
step. Inasmuch as the original goal of the TEI was to promote collaborative
research on electronic texts, by making the encoding system no longer an
obstacle to such work, the Consortium's efforts are similarly directed towards
making the TEI encoding system as effective a tool for creating, archiving, and
sharing textual data as possible. For its members, the TEI Consortium provides
valuable services to assist them in the creation and use of digital resources,
and to help them stay abreast of rapidly changing technologies and
practices.


Following the establishment of the TEI Consortium, a critical priority was the
release of an XML version of the TEI Guidelines, updating P3 to enable users to
work with the emerging XML toolset. The P4 version of the Guidelines was
published in June 2002. It was essentially an XML version of P3, making no
substantive changes to the constraints expressed in the schemas apart from those
necessitated by the shift to XML, and changing only corrigible errors identified
in the prose of the P3 Guidelines. However, given that P3 had by this time been
in steady use since 1994, it was clear that a substantial revision of its
content was necessary, and work began immediately on the P5 version of the
Guidelines. This was planned as a thorough overhaul, involving a public call for
features and new development in a set of crucial areas including character
encoding, graphics, manuscript description, standoff markup, and the language in
which the TEI Guidelines themselves are written. The P5 version of the
Guidelines was released in November 2007.



Impact of the TEI
-----------------



The impact of the TEI on digital scholarship has been enormous. Today, the TEI is
internationally recognized as a critically important tool, both for the
long-term preservation of electronic data, and as a means of supporting
effective usage of such data in many subject areas. It is the encoding scheme of
choice for the production of critical and scholarly editions of literary texts,
for scholarly reference works and large linguistic corpora, and for the
management and production of detailed metadata associated with electronic text
and cultural heritage collections of many types. See the [projects page](/activities/Projects/) for a list of currently
active TEI projects, ranging from small research applications to major encoding
ventures.


The TEI's recommendations have been endorsed by many organizations, including the
US National Endowment for the Humanities, the UK's Arts and Humanities Research
Board, the Modern Language Association, the European Union's Expert Advisory
Group for Language Engineering Standards, and many other agencies around the
world that fund or promote digital library and electronic text projects.
Recognizing its importance in the emerging digital library community, the
Digital Library Federation produced guidelines for best practice in applying the
TEI metadata recommendations for interoperability with other standards.


The success of the TEI has also gone a long way to ensuring that our cultural
heritage will be brought forward into the emerging new networked world, and made
broadly available to the students, scholars, and the wider public.
