<p>General description: (Indiana
Authors) is an LSTA-funded project based on the digitization
and encoding of the 3-volume reference work Indiana Authors
and Their Books, which initially identified approximately 150
monographs by selected authors from Indiana’s Golden Age of
Literature (1880-1920). Since its original conception, the
project grew in scope as a test-bed for &quot;productionizing&quot;
e-text workflows in partnership with the Indiana University
Bloomington Libraries Technical Services department. Another
200 texts in the public domain, and, at the time not yet
digitized as part of the Google Books initiative, were
selected for electronic conversion. Although the encyclopedic
3-volume reference work is at the center of this project, the
online Indiana Authors resource is being launched in phases,
with an initial focus on the encoded monographs that will be
fully integrated with the encyclopedia by late Spring 2012.
This newest release of the Indiana Authors project includes
approximately 250 monographs.</p>
<p>will provide students,
educators, researchers, and the general public, in Indiana
and throughout the world, with a searchable reference tool
that will draw from unique state resources, link biographical
sketches of famous Hoosier authors to full text electronic
texts, and make Indiana’s rich literary history available
online. A three-volume encyclopedia, Indiana Authors and
Their Books, provides the framework for this project.
Published over several decades, the comprehensive work
attempts to include a biographical entry and a complete
bibliography for all book authors who were born, raised, or
educated in Indiana, or who lived in the state for a major
portion of their lives. Among the 7,000 entries are many
famous Hoosier authors from Indiana’s first 100 years of
statehood, including Theodore Dreiser, Gene Stratton Porter,
James Whitcomb Riley, and Booth Tarkington. The
bio-bibliographic entries will link to digitized full-text
editions of representative works by the most famous authors,
and has provided a foundation for future development,
including the addition of more full text editions by other
Hoosier authors.</p>
<p>Implementation description:
Of the approximately 350 monographs that are
currently part of the Indiana Authors Project, 150 of those
were produced through an LSTA-funded grant. The full texts
were generated and then encoded in Extensible Markup Language
(XML) following the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
Guidelines, TEI Lite version P4, at a Level 3 as described in
the Best Practices for TEI in Libraries. Starting in 2009,
the Digital Library Program partnered with the IUB Libraries
Technical Services Department to continue encoding additional
texts not included in the original grant proposal. In this
next round of encoding, full text is generated with optical
character recognition (OCR) software that is then ported into
automatically created TEI templates ready for additional
markup. The TEI templates contain a pre-populated header with
bibliographic metadata from MARC records and other
boilerplate metadata along with automatic insertion of page
breaks. The Technical Services team adds the additional
structural markup to conform to Level 3 of the Best Practices
for TEI in Libraries. Technical Services plans to complete
encoding of the remaining monographs beyond those covered
under the original LSTA grant.</p>
<p>The delivery and discovery capabilities of this site are
implemented using a customized version of the open source
eXtensible Text Framework (XTF) developed by the California
Digital Library. It is served using the Tomcat application
server and Apache HTTP Server software. Local customizations
to XTF at Indiana University include a unique native page
image viewer and a page turner that are both driven
exclusively by the information encoded in the source TEI
files and require no additional software beyond what can be
accomplished by customizing XTF's XSLT templates. This
feature enables switching between text and page images at any
time while navigating a document's structure, and allows
viewing of one or more page images as moveable overlays
simultaneously with the text in the paged text mode. The
actual page images are stored and delivered via the IU
Digital Library Program's Fedora repository. The encoded
texts are stored in a local e-text repository called Xubmit,
which was developed by the IU Digital Library Program. Xubmit
is comprised of web services using Java and Axis, the
Revision Control System (RCS) for file versioning, and a
graphical user interface developed in Java that is delivered
using the Tomcat application server. Along with the XML/TEI
P4 files, Xubmit stores the schema and Schematron files for
the project.</p>

and are, therefore, in the public domain. Permission is
