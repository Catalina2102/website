<ul>
<li>URL: <a href="http://cervantesvirtual.com/">http://cervantesvirtual.com/</a></li>
<li>Host: University of Alicante. Spain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The of the University of
Alicante in Spain (&quot;
Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de
Cervantes&quot;) covers many different cultural and academic
subjects.</p>
<p>Our books are basically public domain Hispanic
classics written or published between the twelfth century and the
nineteenth century, but some contemporary works are also included.
Genres of these books include prose, drama, verse, dictionaries,
history, and others. The books were encoded in digital form
using the TEI markup scheme and the XML markup language. The
digital texts, which are the vast majority of the library works,
are easily accessible in HTML format through the Internet. HTML
files are produced automatically from our TEI-XML source files by
means of XSL transformations.</p>
<p>The library is meant for a wide audience covering different
ages, interests and cultures. Apart from the Hispanic classics,
the library includes such diverse resources as digitised cultural
magazines&gt;,
a library
for children, and academic research resources such as <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/tesis/tesis_catalogo.shtml">PhD theses</a>.
In addition, the digital library has whole sections devoted to many renowned
academic institutions and national libraries of Latin America, who
have contributed their valuable funds to our library for digitisation.
These sections are meant to preserve and promote minority
Hispanic-related languages, and to affirm different Hispanic
cultures. The design of these sections does not only entail the
use of new techniques, but also involves collaboration agreements
whereby staff from the travel
to other centres, universities, and institutions all around
different areas of Spain and Latin America in order to digitise
the documents, objects, and works of art that will be finally
published on the library main server. After some training, staff
from the contributing institutions begin to digitise and correct
the texts which are finally marked-up, supervised, processed, and
published in Spain.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>The project began in late 1998 with a small team of 5 people
performing preliminary trial and error tests to determine the
viability of the project and to find the most adequate production
methods and tools. After this initial phase, massive digital book
production started in March 1999, with about 80 persons working on
digitisation and correction of texts and a small team of computer
technicians mounting the computer infrastructure, developing
automatic tools for efficient production and designing the
publication processes and the web site. The library was opened to
the Internet public in July 1999 with approximately 800 books. By
July 2001, we had reached 5000 entries in the catalogue.</p>
<p>Between 100 to 120 university graduates and technicians
permanently work in this project as librarians, scanner operators,
correctors, mark-up specialists, and computer technicians.</p>
<p>Since the opening of this digital library in 1999, about
70,000,000 accesses have been received in the first two years.
Currently, the average number of pages served is
21,000 daily. 71% of our users are from Spanish speaking countries (Spain
and Latin America), 6% from the rest of Europe, and 23% from the rest of the
world.</p>
<p>Financial support:</p>
<p>The is the result of a
unique collaboration between the <a href="http://www.ua.es/">University of
Alicante</a> and Spain's biggest bank, the Banco
Santander Central Hispano, who have joined forces to create the world's biggest
digital library containing Spanish works.</p>
<p>It represents an
example of a successful partnership between university and
business, with the Santander Central Hispano bank providing
complete sponsorship for the full development of the project.</p>
<p>The University, on the other hand, provides the academic
expertise, technological know-how, and qualified workforce
necessary to fulfill the objectives and ensures the international
use of the Library's resources by means of collaboration
agreements with universities and institutions all over the
world.</p>
<p>Multilinguality:</p>
<p>The library collection focuses on Hispanic literature, history
and culture, in various Hispanic languages such as Catalan, Basque,
and Galician, or Latin-American native languages as Quechua,
Mapuche, or Guaraní in addition to Spanish.</p>
<p>Some of our present multicultural sections include: the <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BC/">Library of
Catalunya</a> and the <a href="http://lluisvives.com/">Joan Luis
Vives</a> Institute, both with works in Catalan language, country-specific
collections as the <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BNC/">National
Library of Chile</a>, the <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BNA/">National
Library of Argentina</a> , the College
of Mexico, the <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/ILL/">José A.
Portuondo Valdor Institute of Literature and Linguistics</a> of
Cuba, and the section about <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/paraguay/">Paraguayan
Literature</a>.</p>
<p>The library also features thematic portals such as <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/DOXA/">DOXA</a>,
about the philosophy of law, <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/BVJ/">Hispano-American
Novel of the XIXth Century</a> (Benito Varela Jàcome fund),
<a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/SLESXIX/">XIXth
Century Spanish Literary Society</a>, <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/aat/">Association of
Spanish Theatre Authors</a>, <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/LGB/">History and
Critic on Spanish Movies</a>,
Literatura
Gauchesca, and also our <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/">Library of
History</a>, and a section on <a href="http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/IIGG/">Geographic
Research</a>.</p>
<p>Other important sections of this digital library, under the
title of Authors'
Libraries, are special collections dedicated to selected
world-renowned Hispanic authors . They consist of personalized web
pages describing their life and works with links to their digital
books within the library as well as to external resources.
Manuscripts and special valuable documents of the authors (like
drawings, photographs, book covers, and personal letters) are
usually provided. In the case of contemporary authors, videos and
audio recordings give a closer appreciation of their
personality.</p>
<p>Aims:</p>
<p>The hopes to act as a
vehicle for the Hispanic academy to promote their works, as a
window to Hispanic literature and culture for scholars of Hispanic
languages, and as a voice for the Hispanic community worldwide
meant to reach an international multiracial and multilingual
student and academic community of Internet users.</p>
<p>The aims to become the most
ambitious project of digitisation of Spanish works through the
application of new methods of electronic publication for mass
documental information.</p>
