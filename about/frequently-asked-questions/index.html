        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>About the TEI</h2>
<h3>What is the TEI?</h3>
<p>TEI is short for Text Encoding Initiative. The TEI is an
international organization founded in 1987 to develop guidelines for
encoding machine-readable texts in the humanities and social sciences.
TEI is also used to refer to the TEI Guidelines themselves, and
to the set of schemas they describe. The term is sometimes also used to
refer to the TEI Consortium (TEI-C), which was established in 2001 to
provide ongoing support for further development of the guidelines.</p>
<h3>How is the TEI funded?</h3>
<p>Since 2001, the TEI is organized as a member-funded consortium. Its funding
comes primarily from membership fees, with additional support from its
institutional hosts and from occasional grants. The TEI Guidelines are made
available online free of charge.</p>
<h3>Who is involved in the TEI?</h3>
<p>The TEI community is broad-ranging and international in scope. Many
participants are located at academic institutions such as universities and
research libraries. They may be involved in digital library programs,
scholarly text encoding projects, computing support units, academic
departments, independent research projects, and many other kinds of groups.
Some participants are affiliated with standards bodies, funding agencies,
governmental organizations, or companies, and some are simply interested in
text encoding.</p>
<h3>How can I support the TEI?</h3>
<p>You can support the TEI in a number of ways. The TEI depends on financial
support from membership and subscription dues, so by joining the TEI as an
institutional member or an individual subscriber you will be making it
possible for the TEI to continue developing and supporting the TEI
Guidelines. You can also support the TEI by participating in its work: by
contributing to a TEI <a href="/activities/SIG/">special interest group</a>, by using the
<a href="../Guidelines/">Guidelines</a>, by participating in discussions on the <a href="/Support/index.xml#tei-l">TEI-L discussion list</a>,
and by contributing stylesheets, tools, and sample texts to the <a href="../wiki/">TEI
wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>About TEI membership</h2>
<h3>How can I join the TEI?</h3>
<p>Please see our page <a href="http://members.tei-c.org/Join">&quot;Join Us&quot;</a>
for information about joining.</p>
<h3>How can I get grant funding for TEI membership?</h3>
<p>Some granting agencies, particularly in the USA, allow applicants to include
the cost of TEI membership in the budget proposal for a digital project that
will use the TEI Guidelines. The TEI encourages projects to do this, and
provides advice and assistance in drafting the portion of the proposal that
describes the project's use of the TEI. For more information and to get help
preparing the proposal, please contact the TEI at info@tei-c.org.</p>
<h3>Can the TEI help me encourage my institution to join the TEI?</h3>
<p>Yes, the TEI actively seeks to recruit new institutional members and is very
happy to work with individuals and projects to build support for TEI
membership at their institutions. If you think your institution should join
the TEI and would like more information on membership benefits, the
application process, or any other aspect of membership, please contact the
TEI at info@tei-c.org.</p>
<h3>My project joined the TEI at one membership level, but we would now like</h3>
<p>to increase (or decrease) our membership level. How can we do this?</p>
<p>This happens quite often: TEI projects may initially become members with
funding from a grant but cannot sustain the membership level once the grant
is finished. Similarly, an institution may join at a lower level when it
first begins using the TEI, but may find after a time that its level of TEI
participation has increased. In either case, to change your membership
level, please contact the TEI at membership@tei-c.org and we can make the
necessary adjustment. We encourage projects and institutions to increase
their membership level when they have the resources to do so, and we
understand that it may be necessary to reduce the membership level when
funding is short. We would much rather have members continue at a lower
level than discontinue their membership altogether.</p>
<h3>Can I attend the annual conference and members' meeting even if my</h3>
<p>institution is not a member?</p>
<p>Yes, the TEI annual conference and members' meeting is open to all.</p>
<h2>About the TEI Guidelines</h2>
<h3>When will the TEI Guidelines be finished?</h3>
<p>The TEI Guidelines define an encoding language that is intended for use in
encoding scholarly resources. Because our understanding of text encoding is
evolving and progressing, and also because scholars' use of digital
resources is constantly changing, the TEI Guidelines require ongoing
revision to remain current and to serve their intended purpose. Specific
versions of the Guidelines are published and remain stable (with changes
only as needed to fix errors). The current version is P5, released in
November 2007; it makes significant changes and improvements over the
previous version, P4, which was released in 2000. Support for P4 continues,
but it is no longer being developed.</p>
<h3>How can I create a customized TEI schema?</h3>
<p>The TEI is intended to be customized by its users. To simplify the
customization process, the TEI supports a tool called <a href="/Tools/index.xml#roma">Roma</a>, which provides a web
interface through which you can make and preserve your customization choices
and generate customized schemas and documentation. The chapter of the
Guidelines on <a href="/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html">Using
the TEI</a> describes the customization process in more detail. You
may also find it helpful to consult the materials provided at this site on
how to <a href="..Guidelines/P5/#body.1_div.1">get the Guidelines</a>
and on <a href="../Guidelines/Customization/">customization</a>.</p>
<h3>What is TEI Lite?</h3>
<p>TEI Lite is a specific customization of the TEI tagset, designed to meet &quot;90%
of the needs of 90% of the TEI user community&quot;. Due to its simplicity and
the fact that it can be learned with relative ease, TEI Lite has been widely
adopted, particularly by beginners and by big institutional projects that
rely on large teams of encoders to markup their documents.</p>
<h3>What is TEI Tite?</h3>
<p>TEI Tite is a constrained customization of TEI designed for use when
outsourcing production of TEI documents to vendors (who use some combination
of OCR and keyboarding). While the canonical version is maintained by the
Council, a derived version is used in the AccessTEI program.</p>
<h3>What is AccessTEI?</h3>
<p><a href="../AccessTEI/">AccessTEI</a> is a partnership between the TEI
Consortium and Apex CoVantage, LLC. TEI member institutions receive a
special rate on scanning of print or microfilm items (if desired) and on
encoding according to a derived version of TEI Tite.</p>
<h3>TEI Lite doesn't have the tag I want: how do I add it?</h3>
<p>(or TEI Lite has too many tags I don't want: how do I get rid of
them?). In either case, the answer is the same: to create a new TEI
customization based on TEI Lite, you need to take the customization file
that produced the TEI Lite DTD or schema, and modify that file, then
generate a new DTD or schema. You should not modify the TEI Lite DTD or
schema itself directly. The <a href="/release/xml/tei/custom/odd/tei_lite.odd">specification file for the P5 version of TEI Lite is available</a>.
Information on <a href="/Guidelines/Customization/use_roma.xml">how to customize a TEI P5 schema with Roma is also available</a>; see also
<a href="/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml">Getting Started with P5 ODDs</a>. The <a href="../Guidelines/Customization/Lite/">customization files for the TEI Lite are also
available</a>.</p>
<h3>How can I find out whether the TEI includes tags for the concept I want to</h3>
<p>encode?</p>
<p>The TEI Guidelines include <a href="/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/REF-ELEMENTS.html">an alphabetical list of all elements defined in
the Guidelines</a>.
You can also <a href="/Guidelines/">browse the full text</a>. If you
need further guidance, try sending a query to <a href="/Support/index.xml#tei-l">the TEI-L mailing list</a> or
contact a nearby TEI project.</p>
<h3>How can I propose a new topic to be covered by the Guidelines?</h3>
<p>The chief mechanism for extending the TEI's coverage is by means of chartered
TEI workgroups. Proposals from workgroups are made available for public
discussion, and reviewed by the TEI Technical Council, before they become
part of the standard.</p>
<p>For an overview of the currently chartered workgroups and links to the work
in progress, visit the <a href="/activities/">TEI Activities</a>
pages.</p>
<h2>About using the TEI</h2>
<h3>What are some projects that use TEI tagging?</h3>
<p>There are too many to list here, and we continually hear about more. A few
high-profile examples include the British National Corpus, the Wittgenstein
Archive, the Women Writers' Project, Perseus, many commercial systems and
publications, and nearly every electronic text project funded by NEH. The
TEI maintains a list of <a href="/activities/Projects/">TEI
projects</a>; if you would like to add or update information about
your project, please send email to <a href="mailto:web@tei-c.org">web@tei-c.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Is the TEI difficult to learn?</h3>
<p>The TEI is a very extensive encoding language and is intended to support very
complex encoding of very complex documents. However, it is not
difficult to learn. The basic concepts are straightforward and the encoding
required for a simple document is no more difficult or complex than HTML. If
your documents are simple and the encoding you want to do is basic, you can
learn to use the TEI in the course of a short workshop (2-3 days), or you
can teach yourself within a week or so. If you need to describe very complex
structures, it will take longer to learn the necessary tags, and it may also
take longer to decide how they should be used. In very complex text encoding
projects, where the markup is used to express complex editorial constructs,
encoders may be trained for a year or more before they feel fully competent,
but this training includes not only the markup itself but also the editorial
expertise necessary to apply it appropriately.</p>
<h3>How can I learn to use the TEI?</h3>
<p>For some people, the simplest way to learn the TEI is to read the <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/">TEI Guidelines</a>. However, the Guidelines are not primarily intended as
a training document, and many find it easier to work with a tutorial or to
attend a workshop. <a href="../Support/Learn/">Workshops</a> are
taught at intervals in various places and also through the <a href="/activities/SIG/Education/">Education SIG</a>. The TEI also
maintains a <a href="/Support/Learn/tutorials.xml">list of online tutorials and other training materials</a>. However you choose to
begin, the best way to learn is to do some actual encoding: choose a text
that interests you, get an XML-aware text editor, and try your hand at
encoding it. (For information on tools to support text encoding, see
below.)</p>
<h3>Where can I see samples of TEI encoding?</h3>
<p>The TEI maintains a small set of <a href="https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts">sample
texts</a> that may be used for experimentation or as models to learn
from. Sample texts are also being collected at <a href="http://www.teibyexample.org">TEI by Example</a> at the <a href="http://ctb.kantl.be/">Centrum voor Teksteditie en
Bronnenstudie</a>. Many projects will also share sample texts
informally upon request.</p>
<h3>What can I do with my TEI-encoded text?</h3>
<p>TEI markup supports a wide range of useful functions including online
publication, searching, text analysis, and conversion into other formats.
There are many tools for manipulating, presenting and querying XML documents
available and <a href="https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Tools">listed in the TEI wiki</a>. The TEI does not directly endorse any of these, however, there is
a <a href="/Activities/SIG/Tools/">TEI Tools Special Interest Group</a> where experiences
with these tools are discussed.</p>
<h3>What tools can I use to author my TEI documents?</h3>
<p>Although you can use any text editor to edit TEI documents, there are more
sophisticated tools available which allow you to validate your encoding
against the TEI schema and perform other useful functions. The TEI does not
directly endorse any of these. However, the TEI wiki contains a list of <a href="https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Editing_tools">software</a> that is commonly used.</p>
<h3>Where can I archive my TEI texts for posterity?</h3>
<p>If you have created a valuable academic resource that conforms to the TEI
Guidelines and you want to ensure that a copy will be available in the
future, you may wish to investigate the possibility of depositing your texts
with an electronic text archive, quite independently of any plans you have
for distribution of it yourself. <a href="http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/">The
Oxford Text Archive</a> is one of the oldest such archives and is
always on the look-out for scholarly digital resources.</p>
